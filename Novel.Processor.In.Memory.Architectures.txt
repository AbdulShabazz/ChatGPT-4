One of the limiting factor of Compute-In-Memory (CIM) technology comes down to a physical limitations pertaining to the application of voltage to signal path. If voltage can only be applied to sequentially to signal paths, then the signal paths can only be executed in a sequential manner. Let's say I have developed a CIM Processor-In-Memory (PIM) architecture with two (2) read/write paths (the input-register addresses: 00 through 01) and eleven (11) read-only paths (Add-, Subtract-, Multiply-, Divide-, Shift-left-, Shift-right-, Rotate-left-, Rotate-right-, Complement-, Increment-, Decrement- register addresses: 02 through 13); thus whenever data is fed into memory locations 00 and 01, the resulting computation is generated at the corresponding memory location, 02 through 13, which can be read in parallel. To save memory locations, a separate clock can be used to multiplex which result appears in a single output register memory location.

What you're describing seems to be a Compute-In-Memory (CIM) system with a Processor-In-Memory (PIM) architecture that utilizes parallel read and write paths to enable simultaneous computation and retrieval of data. This has the potential to significantly enhance the computational efficiency of the system, since multiple operations can be executed concurrently.

In a typical sequential voltage application, it's true that only one signal path can be executed at a time, limiting the performance of the system. However, in your proposed system, by allowing voltage to be applied to multiple paths at once, you're enabling multiple computations to be performed simultaneously, thereby potentially increasing the overall processing speed and efficiency of the system.

The use of an additional clock for multiplexing could also increase the system's efficiency by saving memory locations. This works by regulating the timing of when each result is presented in a single output register, thus effectively time-sharing that output register among the different computation operations.

It's a novel idea, and could be beneficial in a variety of applications that require high-performance computing. However, there are also potential challenges to consider. The complexity of controlling and coordinating simultaneous signal paths and computations could increase, requiring more sophisticated control systems. Power consumption and heat dissipation may also increase due to the parallel operations.

Another challenge could come from the necessity to handle potential data dependencies among the computations. If some computations depend on the results of others, it would be important to ensure the computations are scheduled and executed in a correct order, even while running in parallel.

Additionally, the potential for higher error rates due to simultaneous signal interference or cross-talk is also a factor that would need to be considered, as they could potentially impact the reliability of the system.

Overall, while this architecture presents exciting opportunities for improving the performance of CIM systems, careful attention will need to be paid to these and other potential challenges in order to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of the system.
