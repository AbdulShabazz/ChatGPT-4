Why don't hasher algorithms return the quotient along with the remainder to produce a hashing function with zero collisions?

ChatGPT:

Hash functions are designed to map an input of any size to a fixed-size output, often referred to as a hash code. Their primary purpose is not to eliminate collisions altogether (which would be impractical for many applications due to the size constraints of the hash code), but to minimize the chance of collisions and to distribute the outputs evenly across the possible hash code space.

Now, regarding your question about returning both the quotient and the remainder - this approach would not necessarily eliminate collisions.

    Space Constraints: Most hash functions are designed to produce a fixed-size output, and that size is often much smaller than the size of the input space. If you were to include both the quotient and the remainder in the output, you would significantly increase the size of the output space, potentially beyond practical limits. This would increase the computational and storage complexity of your system.

    Collisions Still Possible: Even if you did include both the quotient and the remainder in the output, that would not guarantee zero collisions. Hash functions work on an input space that is typically much larger than the output space. Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, it's inevitable that different inputs can result in the same output (i.e., collisions).

Remember, the key objective of a good hash function is to uniformly distribute different keys across the hash table, reducing the likelihood of collisions, and not necessarily to completely eliminate collisions. Handling collisions is typically done via different techniques like open addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing) or chaining.

Why not derive a new hash function which uniformly distributes keys across a table following the addition of each key?

ChatGPT:

Creating a new hash function after each addition would certainly reduce collisions, but it comes with other costs and complexities.

    Computational Overhead: Deriving a new hash function each time a key is added is computationally expensive. This overhead would likely outweigh the benefits of reduced collisions, especially for large datasets.

    Rehashing: Every time you derive a new hash function, you would also need to rehash all existing keys in the hash table. This is because a change in the hash function could potentially change the bucket (position) where each key should be stored. Again, for large datasets, this would be incredibly time-consuming and inefficient.

    Lookup Complexity: A key benefit of hash functions is the ability to retrieve values quickly (in constant time, O(1), under ideal conditions). However, if you're changing the hash function after every addition, you would also need to store all the previous hash functions in order to retrieve previously stored values. This complicates the lookup process and can drastically increase its time complexity.

    Predictability: In many systems, it's beneficial to have predictability in the way data is stored and accessed. Continuously changing the hash function would introduce a level of volatility and unpredictability into the system, which can be problematic for certain applications.

Instead of changing the hash function after every addition, a better approach to handle collisions and maintain a balanced, efficient hash table might be to use techniques like open addressing, separate chaining, or even dynamic resizing of the hash table (as done in many real-world implementations). It's also possible to use a more complex hash function that can better distribute keys across the hash table without needing to be changed frequently.
