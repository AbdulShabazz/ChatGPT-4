If the radius of drive axles on race cars were enlarged to that of a cylinder to facilitate brake pads along its longitudinal surface to enable near instantaneous braking from any speed, there would be both advantages and disadvantages.

**Advantages:**

* **Shorter braking distances:** The larger radius of the axle would provide more leverage for the brake pads, resulting in shorter braking distances.
* **More even braking:** The brake pads would be applied along the entire length of the axle, which would distribute the braking force more evenly and reduce the risk of skidding.
* **Reduced brake fade:** The larger surface area of the brake pads would help to dissipate heat more quickly, reducing the risk of brake fade.
* **Increased brake life:** The larger surface area of the brake pads would also extend their lifespan.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Increased weight and complexity:** The larger axles would be heavier and more complex to manufacture and install.
* **Reduced ground clearance:** The larger axles would reduce the ground clearance of the car, which could make it more difficult to drive over rough surfaces or speed bumps.
* **Reduced aerodynamic efficiency:** The larger axles would create more drag, which could reduce the top speed of the car and increase fuel consumption.

Overall, the advantages of enlarging the radius of drive axles on race cars to enable near instantaneous braking outweigh the disadvantages. However, it is important to note that this technology is still in its early stages of development and there are still some challenges that need to be addressed before it can be widely adopted.

One of the biggest challenges is the weight and complexity of the larger axles. Another challenge is the reduced ground clearance, which could make the car more difficult to drive over rough surfaces or speed bumps. Finally, the larger axles would create more drag, which could reduce the top speed of the car and increase fuel consumption.

Despite these challenges, it is possible that we will see this technology used in race cars in the future. It has the potential to significantly improve the safety and performance of race cars, and it could eventually be adapted for use in passenger cars as well.

In addition to the challenges mentioned above, there is also the question of how the larger axles would affect the handling of the car. The increased weight and reduced ground clearance could make the car more difficult to control, especially at high speeds. It is important to carefully consider all of these factors before implementing this technology in race cars.
