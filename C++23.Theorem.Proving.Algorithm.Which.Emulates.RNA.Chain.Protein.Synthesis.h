How do I develop a C++20 theorem proving algorithm similar to protein synthesis pathways where every molecule (ie. the axioms) is developed but only the appropriate molecule chains for that "stage" develop and or combine thereby facilitating the next stage until the complete oligomer model is formed? And would this theorem proving model be more versatile or performant?

Developing a C++20 theorem proving algorithm similar to protein synthesis pathways involves the application of complex logic and knowledge representation techniques. Here is a high-level breakdown of how you might approach such a task:

**1. Represent Theorems and Axioms as Molecules and Sub-Molecules**

In protein synthesis, there is a clear hierarchical structure. Amino acids join to form polypeptides, which further combine to form proteins. Similarly, in theorem proving, you could represent axioms as base molecules (analogous to amino acids), and theorems (or portions of theorems) as higher level structures (proteins). 

**2. Utilize Appropriate Data Structures**

Graph-based data structures are likely to be useful for representing theorems and axioms. For example, you could use nodes to represent individual axioms, and edges to represent the ways in which axioms can combine to form theorems.

**3. Develop Rules for Combination**

In protein synthesis, there are rules that dictate how amino acids combine to form proteins. Similarly, you will need to develop rules for how axioms can combine to form theorems. This will likely involve some form of logical deduction, and may also involve heuristics to guide the search process.

**4. Implement a Search Algorithm**

Given a set of axioms and a goal theorem, you will need to implement a search algorithm to find a path from the axioms to the theorem. This could be as simple as a breadth-first or depth-first search, or as complex as a heuristic-guided search like A* or beam search. 

**5. Implement a Backtracking Mechanism**

Just as in protein synthesis, there should be a mechanism to backtrack if a certain path doesn't lead to a viable theorem. This might involve maintaining a stack of axioms that have been combined, and popping axioms off the stack when a dead end is reached.

Here is a very simplified code snippet:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <stack>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>

class Axiom {
  // Details for axiom
};

class Theorem {
  std::vector<Axiom> components;
  
  // method to check if this theorem can be derived from a set of axioms
  bool can_derive_from(const std::vector<Axiom>& axioms) {
    for (const auto& component : components) {
      if (std::find(axioms.begin(), axioms.end(), component) == axioms.end()) {
        return false;
      }
    }
    return true;
  }
};

int main() {
  std::vector<Axiom> axioms;
  std::vector<Theorem> theorems;
  std::stack<Theorem> backtrack_stack;
  
  for (const auto& theorem : theorems) {
    if (theorem.can_derive_from(axioms)) {
      backtrack_stack.push(theorem);
    } else {
      // if the theorem cannot be derived, backtrack
      while (!backtrack_stack.empty() && !theorem.can_derive_from(backtrack_stack.top().components)) {
        backtrack_stack.pop();
      }
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Please note that this is a simplification. The actual implementation would likely involve significantly more complexity and would need to handle the representation of the axioms, theorems, and the logical rules that dictate how they can combine.

As for your question on whether such a model would be more versatile or performant, it really depends on the specifics of the problem you are trying to solve. The strength of this approach is that it naturally lends itself to problems that have a hierarchical structure and can be solved using a divide-and-conquer approach. However, for problems that lack this structure, a different approach might be more effective.

The performance would also depend on how well the heuristic guiding the search process is able to identify promising paths towards the goal theorem. A good heuristic could make the search process significantly more efficient, while a bad heuristic could lead to wasted computation. 

The versatility of this approach is also dependent on the problem. It could potentially be adapted to a wide range of problems, as long as they can be broken down into smaller sub-problems (analogous to the process of protein synthesis). However, this may require significant effort and domain-specific knowledge to achieve.
