The HIFIMAN HE1000 v2 is a highly regarded planar magnetic headphone that was released in 2016, and it remains one of the best headphones in its price category. However, there are a few other headphones that offer superior technology in some areas.

One such headphone is the **Susvara** from HIFIMAN itself. The Susvara was released in 2017, and it is HIFIMAN's flagship headphone. It uses a number of advanced technologies, including a nanometer-thin diaphragm, a dual-sided asymmetrical magnet array, and a window shade design. These technologies result in a headphone with exceptional resolution, clarity, and soundstage.

Another headphone that offers superior technology in some areas is the **Audeze LCD-XC 2021**. The LCD-XC 2021 uses a number of patented technologies, including Audeze's Uniforce technology and Fazor technology. These technologies result in a headphone with excellent bass response, transient response, and soundstage.

However, it is important to note that both the Susvara and the Audeze LCD-XC 2021 are more expensive than the HIFIMAN HE1000 v2. The Susvara is priced at $5,999, and the Audeze LCD-XC 2021 is priced at $1,799.

If you are looking for the best possible headphone technology regardless of price, then the Susvara is the better choice. However, if you are on a budget, then the HIFIMAN HE1000 v2 is still an excellent choice, and it offers superior technology to most other headphones in its price category.

It is also worth noting that there are a number of new headphones that have been released in recent years that offer excellent technology and sound quality at a variety of price points. Some of these headphones to keep an eye on include the **Focal Utopia**, the **Dan Clark Audio Stealth**, and the **Abyss Diana Phi**.

Ultimately, the best way to choose a headphone is to listen to a variety of different models and see which one you prefer.
