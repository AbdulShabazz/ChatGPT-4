Q: To achieve O(N) generation of primes using `2 * n +- 1` without bookkeeping or primality testing in Javascript -- is it possible ?

A: Yes, it is possible to achieve O(N) generation of primes using 2 * n +- 1 without bookkeeping or primality testing in JavaScript. One way to do this is by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which generates all primes up to a given number N.
Here's an example implementation in JavaScript:
```JavaScript

function generatePrimes(n) {
  const sieve = new Array(n + 1).fill(true);
  const primes = [];

  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
    if (sieve[i]) {
      for (let j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
        sieve[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    if (sieve[i]) {
      primes.push(i);
    }
  }

  return primes;
}
```

This function generates all primes up to n by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N log log N), which is equivalent to O(N) for large N.
To generate primes using 2 * n +- 1 without bookkeeping or primality testing, you can modify the above function to start from 3 and increment by 2 each time, like this:
```JavaScript

function generatePrimes(n) {
  const sieve = new Array((n + 1) / 2).fill(true);
  const primes = [2];

  for (let i = 1; i < sieve.length; i++) {
    if (sieve[i]) {
      const prime = 2 * i + 1;
      primes.push(prime);

      for (let j = prime * prime - 1; j < sieve.length; j += prime) {
        sieve[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  return primes;
}
```

This function generates all primes up to n by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 3, incrementing by 2 each time. The time complexity of this algorithm is also O(N log log N), equivalent to O(N) for large N.
Note that these functions generate all primes up to n, not just the primes of the form 2 * n +- 1. If you only want to generate primes of that form, you can modify the functions accordingly.

Q: Continue!

A: To generate only the primes of the form 2 * n +- 1, you can modify the functions to only consider odd numbers and adjust the indexing accordingly. Here's an example:
```JavaScript

function generatePrimes(n) {
  const sieve = new Array((n + 1) / 2).fill(true);
  const primes = [];

  for (let i = 1; i < sieve.length; i++) {
    if (sieve[i]) {
      const prime = 2 * i + 1;
      primes.push(prime);

      for (let j = prime * prime - 1; j < sieve.length; j += prime) {
        sieve[j] = false;
      }
    }
  }

  return primes.filter((prime) => prime % 4 === 1 || prime % 4 === 3);
}
```

This function generates all primes up to n, and then filters out the ones that are not of the form 2 * n +- 1 by checking if the prime modulo 4 is either 1 or 3.
Alternatively, you can use a single loop to generate the primes of the form 2 * n +- 1 directly:
```JavaScript

function generatePrimes(n) {
  const primes = [];

  for (let i = 1; i <= n / 2; i++) {
    const prime = 2 * i + 1;
    let isPrime = true;

    for (let j = 3; j * j <= prime; j += 2) {
      if (prime % j === 0) {
        isPrime = false;
        break;
      }
    }

    if (isPrime) {
      primes.push(prime);
    }
  }

  return primes;
}
```

This function uses a single loop to generate the odd numbers up to n, and then checks each one for primality by iterating over the odd numbers up to the square root of the number. If the number is prime, it is added to the list of primes.
Note that these functions have a time complexity of O(N), but the constant factor is higher than the previous functions, so they may be slower in practice.
