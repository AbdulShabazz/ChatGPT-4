**Q:** How do I interpret the numbers on motor oil packaging ?

**A:** Interpreting the numbers on motor oil packaging is crucial for understanding the oil's viscosity and its performance in various temperatures. Here's a breakdown of what these numbers mean:

### 1. **Viscosity Rating (e.g., "5W-30")**
   - **First Number (e.g., "5W")**: This number indicates the oil's viscosity at low temperatures. The "W" stands for "Winter." The lower the number, the thinner the oil is in cold temperatures, which allows for easier starting and better lubrication during cold starts. For example, "5W" is thinner than "10W" in cold temperatures.
   - **Second Number (e.g., "30")**: This number represents the oil's viscosity at high temperatures (typically at 100Â°C). A higher number indicates thicker oil, which provides better protection under high heat and heavy load. For instance, "30" is thinner at high temperatures than "40."

### 2. **Viscosity Grade**
   - Motor oils are often referred to as "multi-grade" oils because they provide protection across a range of temperatures. A "5W-30" oil, for example, works effectively in both cold and hot conditions.

### 3. **Performance Ratings**
   - **API Service Categories (e.g., "API SN")**: The American Petroleum Institute (API) assigns categories that denote the oil's performance characteristics. The letter "S" typically indicates the oil is suitable for gasoline engines, while "C" would indicate compatibility with diesel engines. The letter following "S" (e.g., "SN") represents the quality level, with "N" being a more recent and advanced standard.
   - **ACEA Ratings (e.g., "ACEA A3/B4")**: The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) also provides a rating system. "A" is for gasoline engines, "B" is for light-duty diesel engines, and numbers like "3" or "4" represent the performance level and specification for certain engines.

### 4. **OEM Approvals**
   - **Manufacturer Specifications (e.g., "VW 502 00")**: Some oils meet specific standards set by automotive manufacturers. These approvals ensure the oil is suitable for particular engines or conditions. They often appear as codes or numbers linked to brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, VW, etc.

### 5. **Synthetic vs. Conventional**
   - **Fully Synthetic**: Designed for high-performance and extreme conditions, synthetic oils offer better protection, flow better at low temperatures, and resist oxidation.
   - **Semi-Synthetic**: A blend of conventional and synthetic oils, offering a balance of cost and performance.
   - **Conventional**: Traditional mineral oils, often less expensive, but with less overall protection and shorter intervals between changes.

### 6. **Additional Labels**
   - **High Mileage**: Formulated for vehicles with over 75,000 miles, these oils contain additives to condition seals and reduce oil burn-off.
   - **Energy Conserving**: Indicates that the oil meets certain standards for improving fuel economy.

### 7. **Volume**
   - **Quantity (e.g., "1 Quart" or "5 Liters")**: The amount of oil in the container is also an important factor, as you'll need to ensure you have enough for your vehicle's oil change.

By understanding these numbers and labels, you can select the correct oil for your vehicle, ensuring optimal performance and longevity of the engine. Always refer to your vehicle's owner manual for the recommended oil type and viscosity.

**Q:** How much oil does an engine contain and how much is drained off during an oil change ?

**A:** The amount of oil an engine contains and how much is drained off during an oil change can vary widely depending on the type, size, and design of the engine. However, here are some general guidelines:

### 1. **Engine Oil Capacity**
   - **Small Engines (e.g., 4-cylinder engines):** Typically, these engines hold between **4 to 5 quarts (3.8 to 4.7 liters)** of oil.
   - **Medium Engines (e.g., 6-cylinder engines):** These usually require around **5 to 6 quarts (4.7 to 5.7 liters)** of oil.
   - **Large Engines (e.g., 8-cylinder or V8 engines):** Larger engines might hold **6 to 8 quarts (5.7 to 7.6 liters)** of oil.
   - **High-Performance or Diesel Engines:** Some high-performance or heavy-duty diesel engines can hold more, sometimes ranging from **8 to 12 quarts (7.6 to 11.4 liters)** or even more in specialized or commercial vehicles.

### 2. **Oil Drained During an Oil Change**
   - During an oil change, almost all of the engine oil is drained from the engine, but not every last drop. Typically, about **90% to 95%** of the oil in the engine is removed during the process.
   - For example, if your engine holds 5 quarts, you would typically drain out about **4.5 to 4.75 quarts**. Some residual oil remains in the engine due to oil clinging to internal parts, oil trapped in oil lines, or in the oil filter.

### 3. **Factors Influencing Oil Retention**
   - **Oil Filter Capacity:** The oil filter usually retains some oil. When you replace the oil filter during an oil change, this oil is also removed.
   - **Engine Design:** Some engines have complex oil passages or oil coolers that can retain a small amount of oil even after draining.
   - **Drain Method:** Using a vacuum extractor or tilting the vehicle slightly can sometimes extract more oil, though most standard draining methods through the oil pan drain plug are sufficient.

### 4. **Refilling After an Oil Change**
   - When refilling the engine after an oil change, you typically add the full capacity of the engine's oil specification, accounting for the new, dry oil filter.
   - After refilling, it's important to check the oil level with the dipstick to ensure it is at the correct level, adding a bit more if necessary.

### 5. **Consulting the Owner's Manual**
   - Always consult your vehicle's owner manual for the specific oil capacity and the type of oil required for your engine. This ensures you add the correct amount and type of oil to maintain optimal engine performance.

In summary, the amount of oil an engine contains and how much is drained during an oil change depends on the engine size and type, but most of the oil is drained and replaced during a standard oil change procedure.
