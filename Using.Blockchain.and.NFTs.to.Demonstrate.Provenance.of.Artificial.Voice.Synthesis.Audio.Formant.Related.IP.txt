Your concern about avoiding infringement of copyrighted or licensed intellectual property (IP) in artificial synthesis libraries is valid and requires careful consideration. Additionally, your idea of using blockchain technology, potentially in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), to establish and demonstrate provenance of your speech formants is innovative and worth exploring. Here are some points to consider in this context:

1. **Understanding IP in Speech Synthesis:**
   - **Voice Recordings and Rights:** Voice recordings used in synthesis can be subject to copyright. It's crucial to ensure you have the rights to use these recordings.
   - **Synthesis Algorithms:** If your synthesis algorithms or methods are based on existing patented technologies, you need to be aware of potential licensing requirements.

2. **Blockchain for Provenance:**
   - **Immutable Record:** Blockchain provides an immutable ledger, which can be used to establish a clear record of creation and ownership.
   - **NFTs for Unique Assets:** Using NFTs to represent unique speech formants can establish ownership and transfer rights in a transparent way.

3. **Benefits of Blockchain Implementation:**
   - **Transparency:** Blockchain's public ledger allows for transparent tracking of asset creation and ownership.
   - **Security:** The decentralized and tamper-proof nature of blockchain ensures the security of recorded information.
   - **Licensing and Royalties:** Blockchain can facilitate automated royalty payments and licensing agreements using smart contracts.

4. **Challenges and Considerations:**
   - **Complexity and Cost:** Implementing a blockchain solution can be complex and costly, especially when it comes to transaction fees (e.g., 'gas' fees in Ethereum).
   - **Legal Recognition:** The legal recognition of NFTs and blockchain records varies by jurisdiction and is an evolving area.
   - **Environmental Concerns:** Consider the environmental impact of blockchain technology, particularly with energy-intensive platforms.

5. **Compliance with Copyright Law:**
   - **Original Creations:** Ensure that the formants and other elements you create are original or that you have the rights to use existing ones.
   - **Licensing Agreements:** Clearly define the terms of use, distribution, and modification of your assets through licensing agreements.

6. **Collaboration with Legal Experts:**
   - **Consulting IP Attorneys:** Work with intellectual property attorneys to navigate copyright laws and blockchain implementation.
   - **Regular Legal Reviews:** Regularly review your compliance strategy to adapt to changing laws and technologies.

7. **User Education and Transparency:**
   - **Clear Documentation:** Provide clear documentation about the origin, rights, and usage of your blockchain-recorded assets.
   - **Educating Users:** Inform users of your library about the legal implications of using blockchain-recorded speech formants.

In summary, using blockchain and NFTs to demonstrate the provenance of speech formants in your synthesis library is a forward-thinking approach that can add a layer of security and transparency. However, it's essential to balance this with considerations of legal compliance, cost, complexity, and environmental impact. Collaborating with legal experts and continuously educating yourself and your users about these aspects is crucial.
