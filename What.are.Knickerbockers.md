Q: What is a knickerbocker ?

A: A knickerbocker is a type of clothing that can refer to either pants or a type of dessert. Here are the two main definitions:

1. Knickerbockers as pants: Knickerbockers are loose-fitting breeches or trousers that gather at the knee or just below it, typically with a button or tie closure. They were commonly worn by men and boys in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly for sporting activities like golf, hiking, and cycling. The term "knickers" is derived from this garment.

2. Knickerbocker glory as a dessert: In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a knickerbocker glory is a layered ice cream sundae served in a tall glass. It typically consists of layers of ice cream, jelly (jello), fruit, and cream, topped with syrup, nuts, and a cherry. The origin of the name is unclear, but it is believed to have been inspired by the colorful layers reminiscent of the knickerbockers worn by Dutch settlers in New York (once known as New Amsterdam) during the 1800s.
