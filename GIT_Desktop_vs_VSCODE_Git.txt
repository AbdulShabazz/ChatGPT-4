Here's a breakdown comparing GitHub Desktop and the built-in Git integration features ("Git-SCM") in VS Code:

**GitHub Desktop**

* **Focus:** User-friendly visual interface for core Git actions.
* **Target Audience:** Beginners and users who prefer a graphical workflow or interact primarily with GitHub. 
* **Strengths:**
    * **Simple and streamlined:** Less overwhelming than command-line Git for those new to version control.
    * **GitHub-centric:** Seamless interaction with GitHub repositories (creating, cloning, pushing, pulling, etc.).
    * **Visualizations:** Clear representation of commit history and changes.
* **Weaknesses:**
    * **Limited features:** Doesn't cover the full range of Git commands.
    * **Less customization:** Lacks the flexibility and granular control of the command line or advanced VS Code  Git features.

**VS Code Git-SCM**

* **Focus:** Integrated Git experience directly within the code editor.
* **Target Audience:** Developers of all levels who work within VS Code.
* **Strengths:**
    * **Convenience:** Manage Git actions without switching windows or tools.
    * **Efficiency:** Quick commits, staging, viewing diffs, and more, right from your editor.
    * **Advanced features:** Access to a wider range of Git commands and functionalities.
    * **Customization:** Tailored workflows through extensions and configuration.
* **Weaknesses:**
    * **Can have a learning curve:** Understanding Git concepts is still required, especially for complex operations.

**Which One to Choose?**

The best option for you depends on your experience level and preferred workflow:

* **New to Git or Prefer Visuals:** Start with GitHub Desktop. It provides a gentler introduction to Git's fundamental concepts with a user-friendly interface.
* **Comfortable with VS Code and Some Git Knowledge:** VS Code's Git-SCM will streamline your workflow by keeping you within your code editor.
* **Need Full Git Power and Customization:** VS Code's Git-SCM combined with the command line offers the most robust and flexible solution, with the ability to handle even complex Git scenarios.

**They Can Work Together**

Importantly, GitHub Desktop and VS Code's Git integration can be used in conjunction. Often users start with GitHub Desktop to gain a basic understanding, then move to using both together depending on the task.
