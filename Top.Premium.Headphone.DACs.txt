This ranking is based on technical specifications, reviews, and user feedback within the audiophile community up to 2022. However, individual preference can also play a significant role. Always consider testing these devices personally to discern which best meets your auditory preferences and requirements. Additionally, advancements in technology or newer products might alter these rankings in the future.

User:

Provide prices for each.

ChatGPT:

I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. Please note that the prices of DAC/Amp devices can vary based on factors such as region, availability, and any changes made by the manufacturer or seller. The prices I provide below are based on average values from late 2022 and could be subject to change. Here they are:

	1.	Topping D90 MQA / A90
	•	Estimated Price: $1,100 combined (D90 MQA around $750, A90 around $350)
	2.	Chord Electronics Dave
	•	Estimated Price: $10,500
	3.	RME ADI-2 DAC FS
	•	Estimated Price: $1,100
	4.	Benchmark DAC3 HGC
	•	Estimated Price: $2,200
	5.	Mytek Brooklyn DAC+
	•	Estimated Price: $2,195

It’s essential to note that these are estimated prices, and actual costs might vary depending on the seller, region, or potential promotions and discounts. Always consider checking the manufacturer’s official website or contacting authorized dealers for the most current pricing.

The Topping D90 MQA is manufactured by Topping, a Chinese company known for producing high-quality audio equipment, including DACs, amplifiers, and other related products. Topping has gained significant recognition within the audiophile community for offering devices that provide excellent value for their performance.

User:

The device supports MQA playback only?

ChatGPT:

No, the Topping D90 MQA does not support MQA playback exclusively. The “MQA” in its name denotes its capability to decode and play MQA (Master Quality Authenticated) files. In addition to MQA, the Topping D90 MQA supports a wide range of audio formats and resolutions. Here are the specifications regarding its playback capabilities:

	•	PCM Playback: Up to 32bit/768kHz
	•	DSD Playback: Native DSD support up to DSD512
	•	MQA Playback: Full MQA unfolding capability

This means that the device can handle standard PCM files, high-resolution DSD formats, and MQA files, making it versatile for various audio sources and preferences.

User:

Is it compatible with iPhone supported sound formats such as .AAC , .FLAC? 

ChatGPT:

Yes, the Topping D90 MQA DAC is capable of converting digital audio signals from a variety of formats into analog sound for playback through headphones or speakers. When discussing compatibility with specific file formats such as .AAC or .FLAC, it’s essential to understand that the playback capability often depends more on the source device (e.g., iPhone) and the playback software than the DAC itself.

However, for clarity:

	•	.AAC (Advanced Audio Codec): It is a lossy digital audio compression format used predominantly by Apple. An iPhone or any device/software that can output .AAC audio can send the digital audio signal to the Topping D90 MQA for conversion and playback, provided the necessary connections (like USB) are made.
	•	.FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec): It is a popular lossless compression format. If the iPhone or its playback software supports FLAC file playback and outputs it through a suitable interface (again, like USB), the Topping D90 MQA can convert the digital signal to analog for listening.

In summary, the Topping D90 MQA does not “read” these file formats directly. Instead, it converts the digital audio signals sent from source devices that read and output these formats. As long as your iPhone or associated playback software supports .AAC, .FLAC, or any other audio format, the Topping D90 MQA should be able to handle the digital-to-analog conversion without issues. Ensure you use appropriate cables and possibly adapters to connect the iPhone to the DAC.
