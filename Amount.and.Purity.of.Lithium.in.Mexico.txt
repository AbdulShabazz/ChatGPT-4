Bard:

Mexico is estimated to have the ninth largest lithium resources in the world, with an estimated 1.7 million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE). However, most of Mexico's lithium is found in clay deposits, which are more difficult and expensive to extract lithium from than brine or hard rock deposits.

**Is Mexico's lithium battery grade?**

Yes, Mexico has the potential to produce battery grade lithium. However, there is currently no commercial-scale production of battery grade lithium in Mexico. The only lithium project in Mexico that is currently under construction is the Sonora Lithium Project, which is expected to produce 35,000 tonnes of battery grade lithium carbonate per year starting in 2023. However, this project is still in the development stage and it is not yet clear whether it will be able to produce battery grade lithium at a commercially viable cost.

**Challenges to developing Mexico's lithium resources**

There are a number of challenges to developing Mexico's lithium resources, including:

* The difficulty and expense of extracting lithium from clay deposits.
* The lack of experience and expertise in Mexico in lithium extraction and processing.
* The regulatory uncertainty surrounding the lithium industry in Mexico.

**Conclusion**

Mexico has the potential to become a major producer of battery grade lithium. However, there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed before this can happen. It remains to be seen whether Mexico will be able to develop its lithium resources in a timely and cost-effective manner.
