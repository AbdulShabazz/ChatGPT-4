Voice shimmer is a measure of the cycle-to-cycle variability in the amplitude of vocal fold vibration. It is perceived as roughness, breathiness, or hoarseness in a speaker's voice. All natural speech contains some level of jitter and shimmer, but measuring them is a common way to detect voice pathologies.

Shimmer is caused by irregular vocal fold vibration, which can be due to a number of factors, including:

* Vocal fold nodules or polyps
* Laryngitis
* Vocal fold paralysis
* Vocal fold cancer
* Neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis

Shimmer can also be affected by environmental factors, such as noise and air pollution.

Shimmer is measured using a variety of acoustic analysis tools. The most common measure of shimmer is the average percentage deviation of the amplitude of consecutive vocal fold cycles. This measure is expressed as a percentage of the average amplitude.

Normal shimmer values vary depending on the individual's age, sex, and voice type. However, shimmer values above 3% are generally considered to be abnormal.

Shimmer measurement can be used to diagnose voice pathologies, monitor the effectiveness of voice therapy, and assess the risk of developing vocal problems.

Here are some examples of voice shimmer:

* A healthy voice will have some shimmer, but it will be very subtle.
* A voice with a lot of shimmer will sound rough, breathy, or hoarse.
* A voice with a lot of shimmer may be a sign of a vocal pathology, such as vocal fold nodules or laryngitis.

If you are concerned about your voice shimmer, you should see a speech-language pathologist or other voice specialist. They can assess your voice and make recommendations for treatment or further evaluation.

Voice jitter is a measure of the cycle-to-cycle variability in the fundamental frequency of vocal fold vibration. It is perceived as roughness, breathiness, or hoarseness in a speaker's voice. All natural speech contains some level of jitter and shimmer, but measuring them is a common way to detect voice pathologies.

Jitter is caused by irregular vocal fold vibration, which can be due to a number of factors, including:

* Vocal fold nodules or polyps
* Laryngitis
* Vocal fold paralysis
* Vocal fold cancer
* Neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis

Jitter can also be affected by environmental factors, such as noise and air pollution.

Jitter is measured using a variety of acoustic analysis tools. The most common measure of jitter is the average percentage deviation of the fundamental frequency of consecutive vocal fold cycles. This measure is expressed as a percentage of the average fundamental frequency.

Normal jitter values vary depending on the individual's age, sex, and voice type. However, jitter values above 1% are generally considered to be abnormal.

Jitter measurement can be used to diagnose voice pathologies, monitor the effectiveness of voice therapy, and assess the risk of developing vocal problems.

Here are some examples of voice jitter:

* A healthy voice will have some jitter, but it will be very subtle.
* A voice with a lot of jitter will sound rough, breathy, or hoarse.
* A voice with a lot of jitter may be a sign of a vocal pathology, such as vocal fold nodules or laryngitis.

If you are concerned about your voice jitter, you should see a speech-language pathologist or other voice specialist. They can assess your voice and make recommendations for treatment or further evaluation.

Here are some tips for reducing voice jitter:

* Drink plenty of fluids to keep your vocal cords hydrated.
* Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.
* Get enough sleep.
* Avoid shouting or straining your voice.
* Use a microphone when speaking in public.
* See a speech-language pathologist if you are experiencing chronic voice problems.
