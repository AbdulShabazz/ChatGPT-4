Would it be beneficial to add a builtin default check for null-, unitialized variable-,  and other value states likely to cause a crash within a C++ parameter list: int return_data_member_from_pointer(pointer_object p_obj /* function not called when parameter list value is null */, ...){ /* function body */ }

ChatGPT:

Incorporating default checks for uninitialized or null values directly into the C++ language can be beneficial in terms of reducing potential runtime errors, especially for beginners. However, there are several considerations to take into account:

    Performance: One of the primary reasons developers use C++ is its performance. Introducing default checks for every function call could add overhead that might be unnecessary in many cases, especially when the developer knows that certain conditions (like null pointers) will never occur.

    Explicitness: One of the guiding principles of C++ is "You don’t pay for what you don’t use." Implicit checks go against this principle, making the language less predictable. Developers would need to know about these checks and possibly how to disable them for performance-critical code.

    Compatibility: Introducing such a change could break backward compatibility with existing C++ code.

    Variability: Different scenarios might require different checks. While one function might want to check for null pointers, another might want to check for a certain range of values for an integer. Embedding this directly into the language syntax could become unwieldy and less readable.

    Existing Solutions: There are already methods to handle such checks in the current form of the language. For example, one can use assert(p_obj != nullptr); or incorporate error handling mechanisms.

    Standard Library and Tools: The C++ Standard Library and third-party libraries provide smart pointers like std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr, which are safer than raw pointers. Moreover, static analysis tools can catch many of these issues at compile-time.

    Teaching and Learning: Implicit checks might reduce the immediate feedback that a beginner gets from making mistakes, which is valuable for learning. If beginners aren't exposed to the dangers of uninitialized variables or null pointers early on, they might develop bad habits that could be problematic in larger, more complex systems.

In conclusion, while the idea has merit, its introduction to the language would need careful consideration. A more practical approach might involve better tools, libraries, and compiler warnings/errors, rather than changes to the core language syntax.

User:

What if all C++ function definitions embed a final parameter callback called on_error to let the compiler know that these checks are desirable and should be routed to a handler accordingly?

ChatGPT:

Incorporating an on_error callback parameter into C++ functions is an interesting idea that would enable more explicit error handling. Here are some pros and cons of such an approach:

Pros:

    Explicitness: Developers can opt-in for the checks and handlers they want, making the language predictable and ensuring no overhead when the checks aren't desired.

    Flexibility: Developers can define custom error handling behavior on a per-function basis. They could log errors, throw exceptions, recover gracefully, etc.

    Better Debugging: Having explicit error handlers can aid in diagnosing and understanding issues when they arise.

Cons:

    Verbosity: This approach would make function declarations and definitions more verbose. Every function that wanted this feature would need to include the on_error parameter and handle it.

    Cognitive Load: Developers need to remember and decide for each function if they want to include this handler and what it should do.

    Overhead: Even if opt-in, there's a potential for runtime overhead if checks are frequently enabled, especially in performance-critical code.

    Compatibility: Existing code would not benefit from this without significant refactoring. It might also lead to confusion as older codebases would not have these handlers.

    Complexity in Overloads: Functions can have multiple overloads, and deciding which overloads have the on_error callback could be challenging and lead to inconsistencies.

Implementation Example:

cpp

void someFunction(int value, void (*on_error)(const char*) = nullptr) {
    if (value < 0 && on_error) {
        on_error("Negative value passed!");
        return;
    }
    // rest of the function
}

While the idea is intriguing and offers a new dimension of error handling in C++, it also introduces new complexities. If such a feature were to be adopted, it would likely require extensive discussion and testing in the C++ community.

In practice, many of these goals can be achieved using current C++ features (like exceptions) and good design patterns. For developers who need more custom behavior, design patterns like the Strategy Pattern or Observer Pattern could be useful.

Are compiler warnings part of the c++ standard?

ChatGPT:

No, compiler warnings are not part of the C++ standard. The C++ standard specifies the language's behavior, syntax, semantics, and the standard library. It defines what is valid C++ code and what each valid construct does, but it doesn't mandate how compilers should handle non-standard or potentially problematic code.

Compiler warnings are features of individual compilers. They are the compiler's way of alerting the programmer to potential issues, even if those issues don't strictly violate the C++ standard. Different compilers might have different sets of warnings, and even similar warnings might be triggered by slightly different code patterns in different compilers.

For example, the GCC compiler and the Clang compiler both offer extensive sets of warnings, and while many of their warnings overlap, there are differences in detail and coverage.

It's always a good idea to pay attention to compiler warnings, as they often point out potential bugs, inefficiencies, or areas of code that might be unclear or problematic. However, they're not mandated by the C++ standard and are strictly a feature of the compiler you're using.

User:

Should compiler warnings be made part of the standard? Afterall, every product ships with an instruction manual!

ChatGPT:

Making compiler warnings part of the C++ standard is a concept that has its advantages and disadvantages. Let's delve into both sides of the argument:

Advantages:

    Consistency: Developers would get consistent feedback across different compilers, which can be particularly helpful when switching between them or when collaborating on a project with a team using different tools.

    Quality Assurance: If a certain set of warnings were standardized, it could lead to a higher baseline code quality across all C++ projects, as developers would be consistently alerted to common pitfalls or bad practices.

    Education: Warnings can be educational, especially for developers new to the language. A standardized set of warnings could serve as a unified set of best practices.

    Clarity: It would clarify the intentions of the standard. By explicitly warning about certain constructs or practices, the standard can more clearly communicate what's considered idiomatic or safe C++.

Disadvantages:

    Stifling Innovation: One of the reasons different compilers have different warnings is that they innovate and experiment with ways to detect potential issues. Making warnings part of the standard could slow this innovation.

    Overhead: The C++ standardization process is already quite involved. Adding warnings to the mix could slow down the evolution of the language as more debates and discussions arise around which warnings to standardize.

    Differing Goals: Different projects have different goals. What's considered a necessary warning for one project might be seen as noise for another. Standardized warnings might not suit everyone's needs.

    Increased Complexity: The C++ standard is already complex. Adding a standardized set of warnings would increase this complexity.

    Maintenance: As the language evolves, certain warnings might become outdated or irrelevant. Maintaining a standardized list would be an additional task for the standardization committee.

In essence, while the idea of standardizing warnings has its merits, it also introduces challenges and complexities. Currently, the approach has been to let compiler vendors innovate and provide their own warnings, with the community and industry naturally converging on certain best practices over time.

While products do ship with instruction manuals, it's also true that products evolve and change over time, especially in technology. Flexibility and adaptability are crucial, and locking in a standardized set of warnings might hinder the evolution of best practices in C++ development.

User:

What could the standards committee introduce as a stop-gap between standardized warnings and allowing compiler developers to innovate?

ChatGPT:

Introducing a middle ground between standardized warnings and allowing compiler developers to innovate can be challenging, but it's certainly an idea worth exploring. Here are some potential approaches the standards committee could consider:

    Recommendations: Instead of hard standards, the committee could issue a set of recommended warnings. These would serve as guidelines for compiler developers but wouldn't be mandatory. This approach gives some consistency while still allowing flexibility.

    Warning Profiles: Define standardized "profiles" of warnings (e.g., "safety-critical", "performance", "beginner-friendly"). Compilers can then support these profiles, and users can opt into them based on their needs.

    Interoperability Guidelines: Set up a subcommittee or working group specifically for warning consistency and innovation. This group can work with compiler developers to ensure that there's some level of interoperability or similarity in the types of warnings issued for common code constructs.

    Warning Exchange Format: Define a standardized format for representing warnings, making it easier to share, discuss, and analyze warnings across compilers. This could also enable third-party tools to work more effectively across different compilers.

    Community Feedback Loop: Create a platform or mechanism for the community to give feedback on warnings, propose new ones, or discuss the removal of outdated ones. This direct feedback can help guide both the standards committee and compiler developers.

    Educational Initiatives: Partner with educational institutions and training programs to gather data on common pitfalls faced by new C++ developers. This data can help shape recommendations for compiler warnings that target common beginner mistakes.

    Regular Surveys: Periodically survey developers to understand which warnings they find most valuable, which ones they feel are missing, and which ones might be superfluous or confusing.

    Test Suites: Develop test suites that specifically target warnings, similar to how there are test suites for language features. Compiler vendors can then use these suites to assess and improve their warning implementations.

Each of these measures can serve as a bridge, ensuring that the C++ community benefits from a degree of consistency and standardization, while still allowing compiler developers the freedom to innovate and improve upon the baseline.

User:

What about standardizing the category of warnings such as Memory Safety, or Type Safety, etc?

ChatGPT:

Standardizing categories of warnings, rather than specific warnings themselves, is a compelling approach. By focusing on categories, the standards committee can provide broad guidelines without restricting the details of implementation or stifling innovation.

Advantages:

    Broad Guidance: Compiler developers can still innovate within each category, designing warnings that they feel are most effective for their users.

    Modularity: Developers can enable or disable entire categories of warnings based on their project's requirements. For instance, a project might be particularly concerned about performance and thus enable all warnings in the "Performance" category.

    Evolving Best Practices: As best practices evolve within each category, compilers can adapt their warnings accordingly without waiting for the next revision of the standard.

    Educational Value: For newer developers, understanding the different categories can be educational in and of itself. It can help them conceptualize the various types of issues that might arise in C++ development.

Potential Categories:

    Memory Safety: Warnings related to uninitialized variables, memory leaks, dangling pointers, etc.

    Type Safety: Warnings about implicit type conversions, potential type-related undefined behavior, etc.

    Performance: Warnings related to potential performance bottlenecks or non-optimal code constructs.

    Concurrency: Warnings about potential race conditions, improper mutex usage, etc.

    API Usage: Warnings about deprecated API usage or potential misuse of library functions.

    Coding Standards: Warnings related to coding style or practices, potentially customizable to fit different coding standards (like Google's C++ style guide or the C++ Core Guidelines).

    Resource Management: Warnings related to file handling, network resources, etc.

    Boundary Checks: Warnings about array bounds, buffer overflows, etc.

Challenges:

    Overlap: Some warnings might fit into multiple categories. Deciding which category they belong to, or allowing them to exist in multiple categories, would need to be addressed.

    Granularity: Some projects might agree with certain warnings within a category but disagree with others. If categories are too broad, this might reduce the utility of the categorization.

    Maintenance: As the language and ecosystem evolve, categories might need to be revised, added, or removed.

Overall, standardizing the categories of warnings seems like a balanced approach that can provide guidance and structure without being overly prescriptive. It would help bridge the gap between complete standardization and the current state of diverse warnings across compilers.
