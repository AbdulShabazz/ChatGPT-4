**Q:** Regarding performing an infinite number of calculations of an infinite series to arrive at a useful solution which can then be used in another calculation, is it permitted to infer the outcome of such a series if every step cannot be verified as existing or stable ?

**A:** This is a complex and nuanced question in mathematics. In general, mathematicians are very cautious about making inferences about infinite series and processes without rigorous proofs.

The concern is that when dealing with infinities, our intuition can sometimes lead us astray. There are many examples in math of infinite series that behave in counterintuitive or paradoxical ways. So mathematicians insist on formal verification through proofs rather than relying on inference alone.

That said, there are certainly cases where the limit or sum of an infinite series can be determined through analytical methods and proofs, without computing each step. Techniques in real analysis, complex analysis, etc. allow certain infinite series and sequences to be evaluated.

But in cases where the convergence or stability of the series is unknown or unproven, most mathematicians would say it is not valid to simply infer the outcome and use it in further calculations without very strong justification. The risk is that inferences about infinities could lead to logical contradictions or invalid results.

Ultimately, for a result relying on an infinite series to be fully accepted, there would likely need to be a rigorous mathematical proof that the series converges to the claimed value, that the value has the necessary properties (e.g. stability), and that its usage in further calculations is valid. Inference alone probably wouldn't be considered sufficient in most cases.

These are just some general thoughts, but the full answer really depends on the specifics of the infinite series and calculations in question. Expert mathematical analysis would be needed to determine what can be soundly inferred versus what requires further proof. Let me know if you have any other questions!
