To properly serialize a custom JavaScript object using a `for-in` loop and the `hasOwnProperty` method, you would need to iterate over the object's properties, ensuring you're only serializing its own properties (not inherited ones). Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Define the Object**: Assume you have a custom JavaScript object that you want to serialize.

2. **Create a Serialization Function**: You'll create a function to serialize your object.

3. **Use `for-in` Loop**: The `for-in` loop is used to iterate over all enumerable properties of an object.

4. **Check Property Ownership**: Within the loop, use `hasOwnProperty` to ensure that the property belongs to the object itself, not inherited from its prototype chain.

5. **Serialize Properties**: For each of its own properties, append the property name and value to a string in a format suitable for serialization (like JSON).

6. **Handle Non-Primitive Types**: If the object contains properties that are themselves objects, you might need to recursively serialize these properties.

7. **Return or Use Serialized String**: After all properties are processed, the function should return the serialized string.

Here's a sample implementation:

```javascript
function serializeCustomObject(obj) {
    let result = "{";
    let properties = [];

    for (let property in obj) {
        if (obj.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
            let value = obj[property];

            // Handling non-primitive types (like another object)
            if (typeof value === 'object' && value !== null) {
                value = serializeCustomObject(value); // Recursive call
            } else if (typeof value === 'string') {
                value = `"${value}"`; // Add quotes for strings
            }

            properties.push(`"${property}": ${value}`);
        }
    }

    result += properties.join(", ");
    result += "}";
    return result;
}

// Example usage
let myObject = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    details: {
        hobby: "photography",
        profession: "engineer"
    }
};

console.log(serializeCustomObject(myObject));
```

In this example, the `serializeCustomObject` function takes an object as an argument and returns a string that represents a serialized version of the object. It carefully checks each property to ensure it's an own property of the object and handles nested objects recursively.

Note that while this is a manual way to serialize objects, in practice, you'd often use `JSON.stringify()` for serialization, as it's more efficient and less error-prone. The above method is primarily educational and can be customized for special serialization needs that `JSON.stringify()` might not cover.
