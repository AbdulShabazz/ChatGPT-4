how do i combine PDF files on iOS?

ChatGPT:

You can combine PDF files on your iOS device using the "Files" app which comes preinstalled on your device or with the help of third-party applications. Here's how you can do it using the "Files" app:

    Open the "Files" app on your device.
    Navigate to the folder where your PDF files are stored.
    Tap "Select" in the top-right corner of the screen.
    Select the PDF files you want to combine.
    Once selected, tap the "More" button (represented by three dots) in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
    Tap on "Create PDF".

If this option is not available or you're looking for more advanced features, you may need a third-party app. Here's an example using Adobe Acrobat:

    Download and open the Adobe Acrobat Reader app.
    Tap on the tool icon at the bottom, then select "Combine Files".
    Tap on the plus (+) icon and select the PDF files you want to combine.
    After selecting, tap on "Combine" in the top-right corner.
    Save the combined PDF.

Please note that some features in third-party applications may require a purchase or subscription.
