**Q:** What are some suggested performance specs for hifiman's new soon to be released 2024 Susvara ?

**A:** Based on the provided sources, the HiFiMAN Susvara headphones are known for their exceptional performance and high-end specifications. Here are some suggested performance specs for HiFiMAN's new soon-to-be-released 2024 Susvara, drawing from the current model's features and potential areas for enhancement:

### Suggested Performance Specs for HiFiMAN Susvara 2024

#### Frequency Response
- **Range:** 6 Hz to 75 kHz
  - This wide frequency range ensures that the headphones can reproduce both the deepest bass and the highest treble frequencies with clarity and precision[1][2][3][4][5][6].

#### Impedance
- **Impedance:** 60 Ohms
  - Maintaining the same impedance allows for compatibility with high-quality amplifiers, which are necessary to drive these headphones effectively[1][2][3][4][5][6].

#### Sensitivity
- **Sensitivity:** 83 dB
  - This relatively low sensitivity requires a powerful amplifier to achieve optimal performance, ensuring that the headphones can handle high dynamic ranges without distortion[1][2][3][4][5][6].

#### Weight
- **Weight:** 450 grams (15.9 oz)
  - Keeping the weight the same ensures comfort during long listening sessions while maintaining the robust build quality[1][2][3][4][5][6].

#### Driver Type
- **Driver Type:** Planar Magnetic
  - Utilizing planar magnetic drivers ensures low distortion, high dynamic response, and excellent sound quality[1][2][3][4][5][6].

#### Magnet Technology
- **Stealth Magnets**
  - Advanced magnet design for acoustically transparent sound reproduction, minimizing interference from reflections and diffractions[1][2][3][4][5][6].

#### Diaphragm
- **Nanometer Grade Diaphragm**
  - A diaphragm under a millionth of a meter thick, with high tensile strength and low mass, ensuring low distortion and high dynamic response[1][2][3][4][5][6].

#### Connectivity
- **Wired Connectivity**
  - High-quality cables made from crystalline copper and silver wire to ensure low signal loss and high mechanical strength[1][2][3][4][5][6].

#### Design
- **Open-Back Design**
  - This design provides a natural and expansive soundstage, although it may leak sound and offer less noise isolation[1][2][3][4][5][6].

#### Amplifier Requirement
- **Amplifier Power:** Minimum 2W from a high-quality amplifier
  - Due to the low sensitivity, a powerful amplifier is necessary to drive the headphones to their full potential[2][5].

### Potential Enhancements
- **Improved Comfort:** Further ergonomic enhancements to the headband and earpads for even better comfort during extended use.
- **Advanced Materials:** Use of newer, lighter materials for the headband and earcups to reduce weight without compromising durability.
- **Enhanced Cable Options:** Including additional cable options for different connectivity needs, such as balanced XLR and 3.5mm connectors.

These specifications and enhancements would ensure that the new 2024 Susvara continues to deliver the exceptional performance and quality that HiFiMAN is known for, while also addressing any potential areas for improvement.
