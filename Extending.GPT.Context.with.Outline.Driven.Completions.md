**Q:** Instead of fixed context windows in the GPT model, why not have the GPT model maintain a high-level structure or an outline for each proposed completion along with jump-to addresses governed by the outline to finish the context relevant completion contributing to each part of the outline ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** The idea you propose is an interesting approach to extending the context window of language models like GPT beyond the fixed-length limit. Let me break down the key components and implications:

Maintaining a high-level structure or outline:
- Instead of just considering the immediate fixed-length context, the model would generate and maintain a hierarchical outline or structure of the overall content
- This outline would capture the key topics, sections, arguments etc. at a high level
- It allows the model to keep track of the overall flow and organization even beyond the context window

Jump-to addresses governed by the outline:
- For each element in the outline, the model would store "pointers" or addresses to the relevant sections of the full underlying content
- When generating the next token, the model could refer back to the pertinent section using these addresses, even if it's outside the current context window
- This allows stitching together relevant context from different parts of the input according to the outline

Advantages:
- Enables coherent completion of long-form content by providing a scaffolding 
- Overcomes limitations of fixed context window by allowing jumps to relevant sections
- Outline provides a organizational framework to guide completion
- Could help maintain consistency and reduce contradictions by referring back to previously generated content

Challenges and considerations:
- Generating a good outline is itself a complex task requiring understanding of the content
- Need an addressing mechanism to refer to specific spans of tokens across the full content
- Increases computational and implementation complexity compared to fixed windows
- Needs to handle outlines flexibly as structure may change during generation
- Should ensure jumps don't lead to incoherence or abrupt context switches

Overall, I think it's a thought-provoking idea worth exploring further. The key would be designing architectures and training approaches to reliably generate useful content outlines and leverage them effectively to guide coherent long-form generation. Some related research directions include hierarchy-aware transformers, content planning for generation, and knowledge-grounded generation.

Of course, this is just my perspective based on my current knowledge cutoff in August 2023. Language model architectures are an active area of research, so there may well have been new developments and insights since then that provide additional context or alternative approaches. Let me know if you have any other questions!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
