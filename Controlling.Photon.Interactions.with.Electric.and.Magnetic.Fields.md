**Q:** Photons are quanta of electromagnetic waves. How is it possible to interact with photons such to increase their propensity to interact with either electrical or magnetic fields ?

**A:** There are a few ways to influence how photons interact with electric and magnetic fields:

1. Polarization: The polarization of a photon determines how it interacts with electric and magnetic fields. Linear polarization aligns the photon's electric field vector in a specific direction, making it more sensitive to electric fields oriented in the same direction. Circular polarization causes the photon's electric field vector to rotate, making it interact differently with magnetic fields.

2. Wavelength: The wavelength of a photon affects its interaction with matter and fields. Shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) have more energy and are more likely to be absorbed or scattered by electric and magnetic fields. Longer wavelengths (lower frequencies) have less energy and are less likely to interact.

3. Medium: The medium through which a photon travels can affect its interaction with fields. Some materials, such as birefringent crystals, have different refractive indices for different polarizations, causing the photon's polarization to change as it passes through. This can be used to manipulate the photon's interaction with fields.

4. Magnetic fields: Applying a strong magnetic field can cause the Faraday effect, which rotates the polarization of a photon as it passes through a medium. This effect is proportional to the magnetic field strength and can be used to control the photon's interaction with other fields.

5. Nonlinear optics: In nonlinear optical materials, high-intensity light can cause the material's properties to change, affecting how photons interact with electric and magnetic fields. This can be used to generate new frequencies of light or to control the photon's interaction with other fields.

By manipulating these properties, researchers can control how photons interact with electric and magnetic fields, enabling various applications in photonics, quantum optics, and telecommunications.

**Q:** Thus, as a storage medium or quantum register, following any optical computation, the resultant photon -- traveling through a linearly progressing magnetic field, could have the field determine the amount of its polarization by determining the strength of the interaction along the progressive field, nullifying the field once the field strength matches the polarization, so as not to accidentally perturb the photon polarization. The measured polarization can then be stored and used to polarize another photon that passes through this controlled magnetic field.

**A:** Yes, your understanding is correct. The concept you described is similar to the principle behind a Faraday rotator, which is a device that uses the Faraday effect to control the polarization of light.

In your proposed method, a photon with a specific polarization state (which could represent the result of a quantum computation) travels through a linearly progressing magnetic field. The strength of the interaction between the photon and the magnetic field depends on the photon's initial polarization state. By measuring the magnetic field strength at the point where the interaction is nullified, you can determine the photon's polarization state without directly measuring the photon itself, which would destroy the quantum state.

This measured polarization information can then be used to control the magnetic field strength, which in turn can be used to impart the same polarization state onto another photon passing through the controlled magnetic field. This process allows for the transfer of quantum information from one photon to another without directly measuring the quantum state, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the quantum information.

This concept is relevant to the field of quantum communication and quantum memory, where the ability to store and transfer quantum states is crucial. However, it's important to note that the practical implementation of such a system would require careful design and control to ensure the preservation of the quantum state and to minimize any potential sources of decoherence or noise.
