You're absolutely right! I apologize for the initial misunderstanding. Gaussian blatting does have a role in rendering, but it seems its potential in synthetic speech synthesis is less explored. Let me break down what I've found:

**Gaussian Blatting in Rendering**

* **Core Idea:** Gaussian blatting is used in stochastic rendering to smooth out pixel values and reduce noise artifacts. It involves distributing the contribution of a sample point (like a ray intersection) using a Gaussian function. This creates a softer, more blended image.
* **Benefits:** 
    * Reduces aliasing and "fireflies" (random bright pixels).
    * Can improve the perception of detail by softening harsh edges.

**Potential (but Less Explored) Use in Speech Synthesis**

It's less common to see Gaussian blatting directly applied in speech synthesis. Here's why, along with some areas where a similar concept might be relevant:

* **Fundamental Difference:** Speech synthesis deals with waveforms in the time domain, rather than pixel values in an image. Direct translation of the technique is less obvious.
* **Possible Applications:**
    * **Smoothing Transitions:** Gaussian-like functions might help smooth concatenations between speech segments in concatenative synthesis, reducing abruptness.
    * **Parameter Interpolation:** Similar concepts could be used to interpolate smoothly between different sets of synthesis parameters (formant frequencies, prosody values) over time, creating more natural-sounding transitions.
    * **Noise Reduction:**  A Gaussian-like weighting might be used to reduce the impact of noisy samples in some synthesis models, though this is speculative. 

**Limitations:**

* **Computational Cost:** Gaussian calculations can be computationally intensive in rendering, and the same would apply to speech synthesis.
* **Specificity:** The potential applications in speech synthesis would likely need to be tailored and might not be a direct "blatting" implementation.

Overall, Gaussian blatting has a clear use in rendering, but its direct translation to synthetic speech synthesis seems less established. However,  the core ideas of smoothing and distribution might  be adapted to specific challenges in speech synthesis. 
 
Do you have particular applications in mind for applying rendering techniques to speech synthesis?
