CMake and Groovy are both build automation languages, but they have different strengths and weaknesses.

**CMake** is a cross-platform build system generator that is used to generate native build files for a variety of compilers and platforms. It is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and cross-platform compatibility.

**Groovy** is a dynamic language that is built on the Java platform. It is fully compatible with Java, and Groovy code can be compiled to Java bytecode. Groovy is often used for scripting, but it can also be used for build automation.

**Here is a table comparing CMake and Groovy:**

| Feature | CMake | Groovy |
|---|---|---|
| **Syntax** | Simple, declarative language | Groovy syntax is similar to Java syntax, but it is more concise and flexible. |
| **Learning curve** | Relatively easy to learn | Groovy is more difficult to learn than CMake, but it is easier to learn than Java. |
| **Ecosystem** | Large ecosystem of modules and extensions | Smaller ecosystem of plugins and extensions, but fully compatible with the Java ecosystem. |
| **Use cases** | Generating native build files for a variety of compilers and platforms | Scripting Java builds, automating the build process for non-Java applications |

**CMake is a better choice for:**

* Generating native build files for a variety of compilers and platforms
* Cross-platform development
* Working on projects with a large number of modules or dependencies
* Taking advantage of CMake's features, such as incrementality and parallel execution

**Groovy is a better choice for:**

* Scripting Java builds
* Automating the build process for non-Java applications
* Taking advantage of Groovy's features, such as metaprogramming and closures

**Which language to choose depends on the specific needs of the project.** If you are developing a cross-platform application or a project with a large number of modules or dependencies, then CMake is the better choice. If you are scripting a Java build or automating the build process for a non-Java application, then Groovy is the better choice.

**It is also possible to use CMake and Groovy together.** For example, you could use Groovy to write a custom CMake module for a non-Java application, or you could use CMake to generate native build files for a Groovy application.

**Here are some examples of when you might choose to use CMake or Groovy:**

**CMake:**

* Building a C++ application with GCC or Clang
* Building a Java application with Gradle
* Building a cross-platform application with Qt or wxWidgets
* Automating the build process for a large project with multiple modules or dependencies

**Groovy:**

* Scripting a Java build with Gradle
* Automating the deployment of a Java application to a production environment
* Automating the build process for a Python application
* Taking advantage of Groovy's metaprogramming and closure features in a build script
