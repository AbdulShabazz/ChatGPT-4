**Q:** Do the tdf tt really need that race judge counting down with fingers until race start ?

**A:** In the context of the Tour de France (TDF) time trials (TT), the race judge or official counting down with fingers until the race start serves several important functions:

1. **Precision and Synchronization**:
   - **Accurate Start Timing**: The countdown ensures that each rider starts at the exact allocated second, which is crucial for the integrity of individual time trials where every second counts.
   - **Synchronization**: It synchronizes the start time with the official timing system to ensure consistency and fairness across all competitors.

2. **Visual Cue for Riders**:
   - **Focus**: Riders can better prepare mentally and physically as they have a clear, predictable cue for their exact start moment.
   - **Reduction of False Starts**: A visual countdown helps minimize the chances of false starts, ensuring that riders donâ€™t leave too early or too late.

3. **Standard Procedure and Tradition**:
   - **Uniformity**: Having a consistent starting procedure across all events maintains uniformity and standardization, which is important in professional sports.
   - **Tradition**: It upholds the traditional practices of the sport, maintaining the heritage and established norms of cycling events.

4. **Clarity for Officials and Spectators**:
   - **Transparency**: A visible countdown provides transparency and clarity for both officials and spectators, ensuring everyone is aware of the exact start time.
   - **Documentation**: It allows for clear documentation and recording of the start, which is essential for post-race analysis and verification.

While modern technology could theoretically automate this process, the human element adds a layer of assurance and precision that is valued in the high-stakes environment of professional cycling.
