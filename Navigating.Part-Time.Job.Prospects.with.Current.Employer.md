**Q:** I would like to have a new part-time job prospect contact my current employer.

**A:** I understand your desire to have a prospective part-time employer contact your current employer, likely for a reference or to verify employment. However, I would advise caution and recommend considering a few things first:

1. Check your current employer's policy. Some companies have specific guidelines about providing references or employment verification. Make sure you are adhering to these policies to avoid any potential issues with your current job.

2. Inform your current employer. It's generally a good idea to give your current employer a heads-up that someone may be contacting them about your employment. This shows transparency and professionalism on your part.

3. Timing. If you haven't yet received an offer for the part-time job, it might be premature to have them contact your current employer. Usually, employment verification and reference checks are done later in the hiring process.

4. Consider providing references. If the prospective part-time employer is looking for references, consider providing them with names and contact information of colleagues or supervisors who can speak positively about your work, rather than having them contact your employer directly.

5. Maintain professionalism. Ensure that pursuing this part-time job does not interfere with your current job responsibilities or commitments.

Remember, it's important to maintain a good relationship with your current employer while seeking new opportunities. Open communication and professionalism are key to navigating this situation successfully.
