How can C++20 std::map and std::multimap be combined to create a unique and powerful data structure?

ChatGPT:

In C++, both `std::map` and `std::multimap` are ordered associative containers that store elements and are primarily used to do quick searches of keys. The `std::map` stores unique keys, whereas `std::multimap` allows for duplicate keys. 

Let's consider the following data structure, which I'm going to call `MultiKeyMap`. The purpose of `MultiKeyMap` is to store a value with two keys: the first key is unique, and the second key is non-unique. If you're familiar with databases, this is similar to a table with a unique primary key and a non-unique secondary index. 

Here's how you might implement `MultiKeyMap` using `std::map` and `std::multimap`:

```cpp
#include <map>
#include <multimap>

template<typename Key1, typename Key2, typename T>
class MultiKeyMap {
private:
    std::map<Key1, T> primaryMap;
    std::multimap<Key2, Key1> secondaryMap;

public:
    void insert(const Key1& key1, const Key2& key2, const T& value) {
        primaryMap[key1] = value;
        secondaryMap.insert({key2, key1});
    }

    T& operator[](const Key1& key1) {
        return primaryMap[key1];
    }

    std::vector<T> get(const Key2& key2) {
        std::vector<T> result;
        auto range = secondaryMap.equal_range(key2);
        for (auto i = range.first; i != range.second; ++i) {
            result.push_back(primaryMap[i->second]);
        }
        return result;
    }

    void erase(const Key1& key1) {
        auto it = primaryMap.find(key1);
        if (it != primaryMap.end()) {
            T value = it->second;
            primaryMap.erase(it);
            // Assuming that Key2 can be obtained from the value. This could be made more general.
            Key2 key2 = value.some_method_to_get_key2();
            auto range = secondaryMap.equal_range(key2);
            for (auto i = range.first; i != range.second;) {
                if (i->second == key1) {
                    i = secondaryMap.erase(i);
                } else {
                    ++i;
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```
This data structure allows for O(log N) access, insertion, and removal of elements by the unique key (Key1), and also allows for O(log N + M) retrieval of all elements by the non-unique key (Key2), where M is the number of elements with the given non-unique key. This kind of data structure can be quite useful in scenarios where there's a need for a quick search with either unique or non-unique keys. 

It should be noted that the `erase` function assumes that the non-unique key (Key2) can be obtained from the value. If this is not the case, you might need to store the non-unique key along with the value in the `primaryMap`, which would complicate the code slightly.
