The concept as proposed is quite novel, and may not have an exact counterpart in existing libraries.

However, certain elements of the proposal can be found separately in various libraries and projects:

    Concurrency with Fibers: Boost library provides boost::fibers, which implements a form of cooperative multitasking on a single thread, somewhat similar to what we discussed for std::fiber<T>. Documentation and examples are available on the Boost.Fiber documentation page.

    Copy-on-Write (COW): You can find many C++ projects implementing COW semantics for specific use cases, such as COW string optimization in STL implementations. However, keep in mind that this pattern may not scale well for complex, large data structures.

    Read-Copy-Update (RCU): RCU is commonly used in kernel programming. The Userspace RCU library (liburcu) is a C implementation of RCU that could be studied for its semantics, though it's not designed specifically for C++ or the fiber model we've discussed.

    Lock-Free and Concurrent Data Structures: Libraries like Concurrent Data Structures (CDS) and Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) offer various concurrent and lock-free data structures that could be instructive for thinking about thread-safe data management.

Each of these elements provides a piece of the std::fiber<T> puzzle but does not fully realize the proposed concept. The creation of a std::fiber<T> library would likely require combining and extending these techniques in new ways.

Please note that while these resources can provide a good start, the task of combining these techniques to mimic std::fiber<T> is nontrivial

#include <iostream>
#include <fiber> // hypothetical header

// The proposed syntax for std::fiber<T> could be:
template < typename BaseType > 
std::fiber<BaseType> FiberName;

Here, `FiberName` is the name of the new fiber; and `BaseType` is an existing C++ type; 

// A proposed usage example:
int main() {

	std::fiber<int> ctx {10};

    std::fiber<int> fiber1([&](std::active_fiber_context<int>& _) {
        ctx.data += 1;  // Operations on "data"... COW semantics in action - only fiber1's "data" member is changed
        ctx.shared(); // share "data" with other fibers
        std::cout << "Fiber 1: " << ctx.data << std::endl; // 16
    });

    std::fiber<int> fiber2([&](std::active_fiber_context<int>& _) {
        // fiber2 now sees "data" as 11 initially, due to sharing
        ctx.data += 5; // COW semantics in action - only fiber2's "data" member is changed

        // More operations on "data"...

        std::cout << "Fiber 2: " << ctx.data << std::endl; // 16
    });

    fiber1.join(); // implicit join() upon destruction
    fiber2.join(); // implicit join() upon destruction

    return 0;
}


In this API call example, ```struct Data { int id; std::vector<int> numbers }; std::fiber<Data> _fiber_;```, we're creating a std::fiber<> wrapper for a Data struct. Each fiber can independently processes its own Data struct.

Since std::fiber<Data> employs RCU or COW semantics, it can safely read from Data.id, Data.numbers, etc. without causing any data races. Also, if a fiber needs to modify its Data member, it will only copy the parts of the data that it's going to modify (lazy copying), which helps to optimize memory usage.

If the committee decides to make Data's members private by default, then using an accessor-method, we can safely share the Data struct member with other fibers. This is similar to how we can share a std::shared_ptr<> with other threads.

```// Each fiber reads and updates the commonNumber via accessor methods // int localCopy = _fiber_.read(OtherSharedData.commonNumber); localCopy += 1;  // Increment our local copy // _fiber_.write(OtherSharedData.commonNumber, localCopy);  // Write back to shared data //```

Moreover, with deterministic memory management (like reference counting), we can ensure aggregates, such as in ```std::vector<std::fiber<Data>> _fibers_;``` are not prematurely deleted when they are still being used by the fibers.

Hopefully, this example showcases the simplicity and clarity of the std::fiber<T> API, making it easy for developers to create and manage.
