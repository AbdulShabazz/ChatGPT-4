Bard:

The lowest sound pressure level (SPL) still audible to a human is approximately 20 microPascal (Î¼Pa), also known as 0 dB SPL. This is the softest sound that a human with normal hearing can perceive in a quiet environment. The lowest audible SPL varies depending on the frequency of the sound, with humans being most sensitive to sounds between 2,000 and 5,000 Hz.

To put this in perspective, a whisper is typically around 30 dB SPL, and a normal conversation is around 60 dB SPL. A jet engine taking off can be as loud as 120 dB SPL, and a gunshot can be as loud as 140 dB SPL.

It is important to note that prolonged exposure to loud sounds can damage hearing. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that workers be exposed to no more than 85 dB SPL for an eight-hour workday. Exposure to louder sounds for shorter periods of time is also cumulative and can lead to hearing loss.

Here are some examples of common sounds and their corresponding SPLs:

* Rustling leaves: 10 dB SPL
* Whisper: 30 dB SPL
* Normal conversation: 60 dB SPL
* Vacuum cleaner: 70 dB SPL
* Lawn mower: 80 dB SPL
* Motorcycle: 90 dB SPL
* Rock concert: 100 dB SPL
* Jet engine taking off: 120 dB SPL
* Gunshot: 140 dB SPL

If you are exposed to loud sounds on a regular basis, it is important to wear hearing protection to prevent hearing loss.
