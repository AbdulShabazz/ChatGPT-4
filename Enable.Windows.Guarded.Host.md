**Q:** What is Windows Guarded Host and when should i enable it ?

**A:** Windows Guarded Host is a feature of the Windows Server operating system designed to provide a more secure environment for running virtual machines (VMs). This feature is part of a broader set of security technologies provided by Microsoft, known as Shielded VMs and Host Guardian Service (HGS). Here is a detailed overview of Windows Guarded Host and considerations for enabling it:

### Windows Guarded Host Overview

1. **Purpose**: 
   - Guarded Host is primarily used to secure VMs against unauthorized access and tampering, providing a robust security layer that ensures only trusted and verified hosts can run shielded VMs.

2. **Shielded VMs**:
   - These are virtual machines that are encrypted using BitLocker and can only be run on designated guarded hosts, ensuring their integrity and confidentiality even in potentially compromised environments.

3. **Host Guardian Service (HGS)**:
   - HGS is a server role that provides attestation and key protection services to ensure that the host is trustworthy. It works in conjunction with Guarded Hosts to verify their integrity before allowing them to run shielded VMs.

### Key Features

1. **Host Attestation**:
   - Ensures that only hosts that meet specific security requirements can run shielded VMs. There are two types of attestation:
     - **TPM-trusted attestation**: Uses Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to ensure the host's hardware and firmware are in a known good state.
     - **Admin-trusted attestation**: Relies on Active Directory and administrative control for attestation, suitable for environments where TPM is not available.

2. **Key Protection**:
   - Guarded Hosts protect the keys required to decrypt shielded VMs, ensuring that these keys are only accessible to authorized and verified hosts.

3. **Virtualization-based Security (VBS)**:
   - Leverages hardware virtualization features to create isolated regions of memory, ensuring that sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access.

### When to Enable Windows Guarded Host

1. **High-Security Requirements**:
   - If your organization needs to run VMs with high-security requirements, such as those handling sensitive data or critical applications, enabling Guarded Host is advisable.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - In environments subject to stringent regulatory requirements (e.g., financial services, healthcare), Guarded Host can help ensure compliance with data protection standards.

3. **Multi-Tenant Environments**:
   - Guarded Host is beneficial in multi-tenant environments (e.g., cloud service providers) where different clientsâ€™ VMs need to be isolated and protected from each other.

4. **Protection Against Insider Threats**:
   - If there is a risk of insider threats, enabling Guarded Host helps protect VMs from unauthorized access by privileged users.

5. **Enhanced VM Security**:
   - To protect VMs from various attack vectors, including malware, rootkits, and unauthorized modifications.

### Considerations Before Enabling

1. **Infrastructure Requirements**:
   - Ensure your hardware supports TPM and other virtualization features required for attestation.

2. **Complexity**:
   - Setting up and managing Guarded Hosts and HGS can be complex and may require specialized knowledge and skills.

3. **Performance Overheads**:
   - There may be some performance overhead associated with the additional security measures, so it's essential to evaluate the impact on your workloads.

4. **Compatibility**:
   - Verify that your existing virtualization infrastructure and management tools are compatible with Guarded Host and Shielded VMs.

5. **Operational Changes**:
   - Enabling Guarded Host might necessitate changes to operational procedures, including VM deployment and management processes.

### Conclusion

Enabling Windows Guarded Host is a robust solution for securing virtual machines in environments that demand high security, regulatory compliance, and protection against various threats. It is particularly suited for organizations with stringent security requirements and those operating in regulated industries. However, it is crucial to carefully assess infrastructure capabilities, operational impact, and complexity before implementation.
