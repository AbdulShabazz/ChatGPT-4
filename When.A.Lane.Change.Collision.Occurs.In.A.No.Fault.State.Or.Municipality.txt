If i'm driving in the cruising lane of a highway and then engage my left-directional signal to hop into the passing lane and a vehicle in that lane impacts my vehicle from behind whom is at fault? Assume we are not in a no-fault state such as Massachusetts.

The assignment of fault in a car accident is a complex issue that can depend on a variety of factors, including the specific traffic laws in your state and the actions of both drivers before the accident. However, in many cases, the driver who hits another vehicle from behind is usually considered at fault, because they are generally expected to maintain a safe following distance that allows them to stop or avoid a collision if the car in front of them slows down or changes lanes.

However, if you did not check your blind spot or signal your intentions properly before changing lanes, you could also be considered partially at fault. In some states, this could lead to a "comparative negligence" or "contributory negligence" ruling, where both drivers share the blame for the accident to some degree.

Please consult with a legal expert or insurance professional to better understand your specific circumstances. This is only a generalized explanation and may not apply to all situations or jurisdictions.
