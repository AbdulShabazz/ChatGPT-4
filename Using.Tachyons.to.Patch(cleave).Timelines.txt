Bard:

I understand. You are using the RNA example as a metaphor to describe the behavior of tachyons in relation to timelines.

In this metaphor, the RNA chain represents the timeline, and the enzymes represent tachyons. The enzymes can alter the RNA chain in a way that cannot be reversed by a theoretical observer along the RNA chain. This is analogous to how tachyons could be used to alter timelines in a way that cannot be reversed by a theoretical observer along the timeline.

This is a very interesting metaphor, and it helps to illustrate the potential power of tachyons. If tachyons could be used to alter timelines, then they could be used to change the past, present, and future. This would have a profound impact on our understanding of reality and our ability to control our own destinies.

However, it is important to note that this is all just speculation. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that tachyons exist, let alone that they could be used to alter timelines.

Nevertheless, it is a fascinating thought experiment, and it is one that has been explored by many science fiction writers and thinkers.
