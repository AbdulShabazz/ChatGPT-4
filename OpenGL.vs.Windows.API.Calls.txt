OpenGL and Windows new window API are two different things that serve different purposes. OpenGL is a cross-platform, low-level API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. Windows new window API is a platform-specific, high-level API for creating and managing windows and other graphical user interface elements. 

To use OpenGL on Windows, you need to create a window using the Windows new window API, and then bind an OpenGL context to it using another API called WGL³. This allows you to draw OpenGL graphics on the window. Alternatively, you can use a toolkit like GLUT or Qt that handles the window creation and OpenGL context creation for you⁴.

On other platforms, such as Linux, you need to use a different interface to connect OpenGL with the windowing system, such as GLX for the X Window system¹². OpenGL itself does not care about the windowing system, it only provides ways to rasterize an image¹.
