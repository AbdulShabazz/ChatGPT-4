I can't bring myself to watch it. I'm a tremendous fan of Jeffrey Wright, since his role in Syrianna, and the James Bond film: No Time to Die.He even played the voice of Isaac in the smash video game -- The Last of Us: Part 2.

But a film about a character, dissatisfied with stereotypical minority characterizations and similar tropes, that are then portrayed in the film... ? 

Somehow feel the jokes on me.
