**Q:** If the speed of light is constant why is there a Red Shift ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** The red shift in astronomy is not caused by a change in the speed of light, which remains constant. Instead, it's due to the expansion of the universe. Here's a concise explanation:

1. The speed of light is constant in a vacuum.

2. Red shift occurs because:
   - The universe is expanding
   - Light sources (like galaxies) are moving away from us

3. As light travels through expanding space, its wavelength stretches.

4. Longer wavelengths of visible light appear redder, hence "red shift."

This phenomenon is similar to the Doppler effect for sound, but it's caused by the expansion of space itself rather than objects moving through space.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
