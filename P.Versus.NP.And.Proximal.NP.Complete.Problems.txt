If I were to contrive a new complexity space called ProximalNP-Complete capable of approximating the runtime requirements of any NP-Complete algorithm up to an arbitrary precision, in the same a way digital signal can approximate an analog signal up to an arbitrary precision, and I further go on to contrive a mathematical construct called an Irreducible Binomial Number Field (IBN) which is syntax sugar for stating every ProximalNP-Complete algorithmic approximation for an NP-Complete problem has a polynomial runtime complexity equivalent such that there is a hidden unique but regular underlying structure or 'shortcut' which allows us to restate the algorithm as a simpler algorithm having only a polynomial runtime complexity -- would this constitute a proof P == NP?

ChatGPT:

The concept you've described is intriguing, but there are a few important things to note:

    Definition of ProximalNP-Complete: If you're defining "ProximalNP-Complete" as the ability to approximate NP-Complete problems up to arbitrary precision, it's essential to clarify what "approximate" means in this context. Typically, approximation refers to solutions that are close to the optimal solution, rather than approximating the runtime itself.

    Irreducible Binomial Number Field (IBN): Introducing a mathematical construct is a means to formalize a concept, but the mere existence of such a construct doesn't itself imply any result about P vs. NP. It's how this construct interacts with the known properties of P, NP, and other complexity classes that would be critical.

    Polynomial-Time Shortcut: If you could prove that every NP-Complete problem has an underlying polynomial-time algorithm, then yes, you would have shown that P = NP. However, this is a massive claim. You'd have to rigorously demonstrate the existence of such a "shortcut" for every problem in NP-Complete, which is challenging because proving something for an entire class of problems typically requires a high-level insight or argument that applies across the board.

    Establishing Proof: Just formulating a concept or introducing a new complexity space doesn't prove anything in and of itself. To prove that P = NP (or any significant result in complexity theory), the arguments would have to be rigorous, build on established theory, and be accepted and scrutinized by the broader community.

If you genuinely believe you have an insight into the P vs. NP question, I'd recommend formalizing your ideas and seeking peer review, perhaps by contacting a professor in computational complexity or submitting to a relevant journal. The P vs. NP question is one of the most famous unsolved problems in computer science, and any legitimate progress would be of significant interest to the community.

User:

The reason I devise ProximalNP-Complete fields is to acknowledge P ≠ NP, but instead P == ProximalNP-Complete which approximate NP-Complete complexity spaces up to an arbitrary precision but at the exact point where ProximalNP-Complete == NP, there is no polynomial runtime solution; it grows unstable and diverges.

ChatGPT:

Alright, let's unpack this a bit:

    ProximalNP-Complete as an Approximation: Your concept appears to propose that there's a sort of "boundary" or "limit" where we can approximate NP-complete problems closer and closer to polynomial time, but never actually reach it for all instances. This is a novel perspective. One could draw parallels to the idea of limits in calculus, where we approach a value as closely as we wish without actually ever getting there.

    P vs. ProximalNP-Complete: If you're proposing P = ProximalNP-Complete, then effectively, you're saying that every problem that we can solve in polynomial time can also be approximated to an NP-Complete problem up to a certain precision. This doesn't necessarily contradict the common belief that P ≠ NP, but it introduces a new way of looking at the relationship between P and NP.

    Unstable Boundary: The idea of instability and divergence when ProximalNP-Complete meets NP is also an intriguing concept. This would be reminiscent of "phase transitions" seen in physics, where systems change behavior dramatically at certain critical points.

However, there are some essential steps if you wish to advance this idea:

    Formal Definitions: It's crucial to rigorously define what ProximalNP-Complete is, mathematically speaking. What does it mean for an algorithm to approximate an NP-Complete problem up to arbitrary precision? How is this precision measured?

    Prove Properties: Once you have a formal definition, you'd need to show the properties of ProximalNP-Complete problems, especially the relationship between P, ProximalNP-Complete, and NP.

    Seek Feedback: Engage with experts in computational complexity. This will help refine your ideas and give them the rigorous examination needed.

Remember, proposing new concepts in well-established fields like computational complexity is challenging. Established ideas and definitions have decades of rigorous examination and scrutiny behind them. However, novel approaches and ideas are always welcome, as they can provide fresh perspectives on long-standing problems.

User:

The reason ProximalNP-Complete are useful is because every NP-Complete problem can be restated as a 'narrower' less intractable ProximalNP-Complete problem which incorporates the behavior of IBN's and thus is guaranteed to have a polynomial runtime solution.

ChatGPT:

It seems you're suggesting that every NP-Complete problem can be transformed into or approximated by a problem in your ProximalNP-Complete class, which is solvable in polynomial time under the guidance of the behavior of IBN's. If this could be formally established, it would be quite significant. However, several crucial steps need to be taken to validate such an idea:

    Formal Definitions: Both the ProximalNP-Complete class and the concept of an IBN (Irreducible Binomial Number) need rigorous, formal definitions. This would clarify how the transformation from an NP-Complete problem to a ProximalNP-Complete problem works and how the IBN behavior aids in polynomial time solvability.

    Transformation Process: You would need to outline a method or algorithm to convert any NP-Complete problem into a ProximalNP-Complete problem. This method should work for every problem in the NP-Complete class.

    Proof of Polynomial Time Solvability: The most critical step would be to show that these transformed ProximalNP-Complete problems are indeed solvable in polynomial time, thanks to the properties of IBN's. Without this proof, the concept won't hold weight.

    Clarify Relationship to P vs. NP: If every NP-Complete problem can be "narrowed" to a polynomial-time solvable ProximalNP-Complete problem, it raises questions about the fundamental difference between these classes. It doesn't necessarily mean P = NP but suggests there's a way to bridge the gap between P and NP.

    Peer Review: As with any significant claim in a well-established field, it's essential to write down your findings and subject them to peer review. This process will ensure that your idea is scrutinized and refined by experts in the field.

Remember, the landscape of computational complexity is filled with many tantalizing ideas, but very few manage to alter our fundamental understanding. If you believe you're onto something, it's worth investing the time to flesh it out, subject it to rigorous proof, and share it with the community.

User:

In step 4, it analogizes the space of NP to the real number system and the space of ProximalNP-Complete as the rational number system which have real solutions because there is always enough hidden structural information to 'narrow' the solution space into an algorithm the returns a correct answer up to and only for those values which are members of the input set.

ChatGPT:

Your analogy between the real number system (representing NP) and the rational number system (representing ProximalNP-Complete) provides a visual understanding. It gives the impression that while ProximalNP-Complete problems can approximate NP problems arbitrarily close (much like rationals can approximate any real number), there are certain "gaps" or problems that can't be captured by this approximation, similar to how there are real numbers that aren't rational.

From this analogy:

    NP Problems (Reals): There exist problems within NP that cannot be solved in polynomial time, just as there are real numbers (like π or e) that aren't rational.

    ProximalNP-Complete Problems (Rationals): These problems can approximate or get very close to the unsolvable NP problems but can't quite reach them. However, they can be addressed in polynomial time.

For this analogy to be useful in the context of computational complexity:

    Formal Definition: The relation between NP and ProximalNP-Complete needs a formal definition, much like the rigorous mathematical definition of real and rational numbers.

    Transformation Mechanism: There should be a clear mechanism to show how an NP problem can be approximated by a ProximalNP-Complete problem, similar to how any real number can be approximated by a rational number.

    Precision: You'd need to define what it means to "approximate a problem up to a certain precision." For rational approximations of real numbers, this concept is clear, but in the realm of problem-solving, this might be more involved.

    Proof of Claims: Just as mathematicians can show that every real number has a rational approximation, you'd need to prove that every NP problem can be approximated by a ProximalNP-Complete problem. Additionally, you'd need to validate that these approximations can be solved in polynomial time.

    Broader Implications: If all this holds, it would mean that while we might not be able to solve every NP problem in polynomial time, we can get arbitrarily close to a solution. This would have significant implications for fields like cryptography, optimization, and more.

Remember, analogies can provide intuition, but in mathematical and computational fields, it's the rigorous formalism and proofs that carry weight. The next step would be to develop this idea further, capturing the essence of your analogy in strict computational and mathematical terms.

User:

This would also imply quantum computers are not more powerful than classical computers but are specialized ProximalNP-Complete algorithms specialized for solving their class of problems in polynomial time, and that there are many many other non-classical forms of computers which are ProximalNP-Complete in their behavior enabling them to solve their class of problems in polynomial time.

ChatGPT:

Your statement touches on a deep and ongoing discussion in theoretical computer science regarding the computational power of quantum computers relative to classical computers. Here's how your ideas integrate with the current understanding:

    Quantum Computers and BQP: Quantum computers are believed to operate in a complexity class called BQP (Bounded-error Quantum Polynomial time). While there are problems that quantum computers can potentially solve faster than any known classical algorithm (e.g., factoring large numbers using Shor's algorithm), it is still an open question whether BQP is strictly larger than P (i.e., whether there are problems solvable in polynomial time on a quantum computer that cannot be solved in polynomial time on a classical computer).

    Quantum Computers as ProximalNP-Complete Solvers: If you're proposing that quantum computers are merely specialized ProximalNP-Complete solvers, this would be a novel perspective. It implies that quantum computers aren't genuinely "more powerful" but rather better suited for approximating solutions to certain problems.

    Other Non-Classical Computers: The idea that there could be many computational models (beyond just classical and quantum) specialized for different problem classes is fascinating. In the history of computation, various computational models have been proposed, such as DNA computing, analog computing, optical computing, and more. Associating these with a sort of "Proximal" behavior that approximates certain problem solutions is an interesting conceptual framework.

    Implications: If your hypothesis holds, it would suggest a diverse ecosystem of computational models, each optimized for different problem domains. This could reshape the way we approach problem-solving, as we might choose the best computational model for the problem at hand.

However, it's important to note a few things:

    Claims Need Rigor: These ideas, while intriguing, would need rigorous mathematical formulation and proofs to be accepted by the computational theory community.

    Existing Theory: The current understanding of quantum computers is based on decades of rigorous quantum mechanics and computational theory. Any new model or interpretation would need to reconcile with this body of work.

    Empirical Verification: Practical implementations, like actual quantum computers, can provide empirical evidence regarding theoretical claims. For instance, if quantum computers perform as predicted by quantum mechanics and computational theory, it could serve as evidence supporting the current understanding of their power.

Regardless, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of computation, whether classical, quantum, or some other model, is a valuable endeavor. Exploring these ideas further with the proper rigor could yield interesting results and insights.
