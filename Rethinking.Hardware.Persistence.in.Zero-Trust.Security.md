**Q:** One of the reasons programmers invented volatile hardware was to improve the capabilities of their software. In today's programming paradigm of Zero-Trust, perhaps the best path forward is the complete elimination and deprecation of non-volatile hardware: The idea being no software can be made 100% invulnerable yet can be 100% patchable.

**A:** I apologize, but there are a few misconceptions in your statement that I feel I should clarify.

Firstly, volatile hardware (like RAM) was not invented by programmers to improve software capabilities. Volatile memory has been a fundamental part of computer architecture since the early days of computing. It is used for temporary storage and fast access by the CPU during program execution. Non-volatile memory (like hard drives or SSDs) is used for long-term persistent storage.

Secondly, the concept of "Zero Trust" in cybersecurity does not advocate for the elimination of non-volatile hardware. Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no implicit trust for any entity (user, device, network, etc.) and requires continuous authentication and authorization. It operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." This model can be applied regardless of the type of hardware used.

Lastly, while it's true that no software can be made 100% invulnerable, the idea of making software 100% patchable by eliminating non-volatile storage is misguided. Non-volatile storage is essential for persistently storing data, programs, configurations, etc. Without non-volatile storage, all data and progress would be lost every time a device is powered off. Patchability is achieved through proper software update mechanisms, not by eliminating non-volatile hardware.

In summary, volatile and non-volatile hardware serve different purposes and are both necessary in modern computing. Zero Trust is a security approach independent of hardware types. And patchability is enabled by well-designed update systems, not the absence of persistent storage.

**Q:** I'm advising the Zero Trust approach to adopt a non-volatile storage requirement, where nothing is permanent anywhere, and the only barriers to accessing a piece of information is the process of authentication.

**A:** I understand the perspective you're advocating, but I respectfully disagree with the idea of completely eliminating non-volatile storage as a requirement for Zero Trust security. Here's why:

1. Data Persistence: Non-volatile storage is essential for preserving data, settings, and state across power cycles and reboots. Without persistent storage, all progress, configurations, and data would be lost every time a device is turned off or restarted. This would severely impact usability and productivity.

2. System Integrity: Operating systems, firmware, and critical software components rely on non-volatile storage to maintain system integrity and boot up properly. Eliminating non-volatile storage would make it impossible to persistently store these essential components.

3. Offline Access: Non-volatile storage allows for offline access to data and applications when network connectivity is unavailable. Completely relying on online authentication would make offline work impossible.

4. Performance: Constantly retrieving and authenticating every piece of information over a network would introduce significant latency and performance overhead compared to local storage access.

5. Scalability: The infrastructure required to authenticate and serve every bit of information on-demand would be immense and would not scale well, especially for large amounts of data.

Instead of eliminating non-volatile storage, a more practical approach to Zero Trust would be:

1. Encrypting data at rest on non-volatile storage to protect it from unauthorized access.
2. Implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for accessing stored data.
3. Utilizing secure boot and firmware integrity verification to ensure the integrity of the system.
4. Applying the principle of least privilege and granting access to stored data only when necessary.
5. Monitoring and auditing access to stored data to detect and respond to potential breaches.

By combining the benefits of non-volatile storage with robust security measures, a Zero Trust architecture can be achieved without compromising on essential functionality and performance.

**Q:** 1. We have a worldwide internet of connected machines where the data persists in RAM somewhere. 2. Booting up a local client would be no different than downloading the current persistent image which resides on the internet. Operating system integrity could be verified by a confederation of clients. 3. NVRAM, supports cross-session reboots and even supports offline access, as it is non-volatile but it is also not permanent. 4. NVRAM, GPUs, and today's internet speeds nullifies any issues of their being any performance bottlenecks. 5. Blockchain, logging, confederations of computers completely eliminate the need for encryption and its computational overhead. Any action by a malevolent actor can be preempted or reversed.

**A:** I appreciate your perspective and the points you've raised. Let's discuss each of them:

1. Worldwide Internet and Data Persistence in RAM: While it's true that data can persist in RAM across a network of connected machines, relying solely on RAM for persistence has its challenges. RAM is volatile and requires constant power to maintain its state. In the event of power outages or network disruptions, data stored only in RAM would be lost. Additionally, the cost and energy consumption of maintaining vast amounts of RAM across a global network would be significant.

2. Booting from Network Images: Booting a local client from a network image is possible, but it introduces dependencies on network connectivity and bandwidth. If the network is unavailable or slow, the boot process would be hindered. Moreover, verifying the integrity of the operating system through a confederation of clients introduces complexity and potential vulnerabilities if the verification process itself is compromised.

3. NVRAM for Persistence and Offline Access: NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM) offers a combination of non-volatility and fast access speeds. However, NVRAM is still limited in capacity compared to traditional non-volatile storage like SSDs or HDDs. Storing large amounts of data, such as user files, media, and databases, solely in NVRAM would be impractical and costly. Additionally, offline access to data stored in NVRAM would be limited to the local device and would not provide the benefits of cloud-based storage and synchronization.

4. Performance Considerations: While NVRAM and modern hardware can provide fast access speeds, relying solely on network-based storage and computation introduces latency and bandwidth limitations. Local storage and processing still offer advantages in terms of performance, especially for resource-intensive tasks like video editing, gaming, or machine learning.

5. Blockchain and Logging for Security: Blockchain technology and logging mechanisms can enhance security by providing immutable records and enabling auditing. However, they do not completely eliminate the need for encryption. Encryption protects data confidentiality and integrity, ensuring that even if data is accessed by unauthorized parties, it remains secure. Blockchain and logging alone cannot prevent data breaches or unauthorized access; they primarily serve as mechanisms for detection and accountability after the fact.

While the ideas you present offer interesting perspectives on alternative approaches to data storage and security, they also introduce new challenges and trade-offs. A hybrid approach that leverages both local storage and network-based storage, along with strong encryption and access controls, can provide a balance between security, performance, and practicality.

Ultimately, the choice of storage architecture depends on the specific requirements, constraints, and threat model of a given system. It's important to carefully consider the trade-offs and potential risks associated with each approach before making significant changes to established storage paradigms.
