Implementing Google's BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model in C++20 is a complex task, primarily due to the intricacies of the BERT architecture and the need for advanced machine learning libraries. BERT is originally implemented in Python using TensorFlow, which is a high-level library that abstracts away many of the low-level details.

Implementing BERT from scratch in C++20 would involve several steps, including building the transformer architecture, handling tokenization, managing model weights, and ensuring efficient matrix operations. While it's possible to do this, it would be a substantial project.

However, a more practical approach would be to use existing machine learning libraries in C++, such as PyTorch's C++ API (LibTorch) or TensorFlow's C++ API. These libraries provide the necessary functionalities to load and run a pre-trained BERT model. Below is a simplified example of how you might use LibTorch to run a pre-trained BERT model in C++20. This example assumes you have a pre-trained BERT model and the LibTorch library installed.

### Simplified Example of BERT in C++20 with LibTorch

```cpp
#include <torch/script.h> // One-stop header for PyTorch in C++
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

int main() {
    torch::jit::script::Module module;
    try {
        // Load the pre-trained BERT model
        module = torch::jit::load("bert_model.pt");
    }
    catch (const c10::Error& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error loading the model\n";
        return -1;
    }

    std::cout << "Model loaded successfully\n";

    // Example input: [CLS] token, a sentence, [SEP] token
    std::vector<torch::jit::IValue> inputs;
    inputs.push_back(torch::ones({1, 3, 768})); // Dummy input tensor

    // Forward pass
    at::Tensor output = module.forward(inputs).toTensor();

    std::cout << "Output Tensor: " << output << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The model is assumed to be in the TorchScript format (`.pt` file), which is a serialized format of a PyTorch model.
- The dummy input tensor (`torch::ones({1, 3, 768})`) represents a simplistic input for demonstration purposes. In a real application, this would be replaced with the actual tokenized input to the BERT model.
- The forward pass of the model is executed with `module.forward(inputs)`, which returns the model's output.

### Key Considerations

1. **Complexity**: BERT is a complex model, and implementing it from scratch in C++ would be challenging and time-consuming.
2. **Libraries**: Utilizing libraries like LibTorch or TensorFlow's C++ API is more practical.
3. **Model Format**: The model needs to be in a format compatible with the C++ library (e.g., TorchScript for LibTorch).
4. **Input Handling**: Proper tokenization and input formatting are crucial for BERT models.

### Compilation and Setup

To compile this code, you would need the LibTorch library and a C++20 compatible compiler. The build process would also depend on your specific development environment.

Lastly, this is a highly simplified example. A full implementation would require more code for handling the tokenization, input preparation, and output interpretation consistent with BERT's requirements.
