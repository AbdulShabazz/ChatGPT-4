A uniform normal distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution that has a constant density function over a finite interval. One benefit of using a uniform normal distribution to model features for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) is that it can capture the uncertainty or variability of the features without imposing any strong assumptions about their shape or structure. Another benefit is that it can simplify the computation of the likelihood function for the HMM, since the uniform normal distribution has a closed-form expression for its probability density function. A third benefit is that it can avoid the problem of overfitting or underfitting the features, since the uniform normal distribution has a fixed variance and does not depend on any parameters that need to be estimated from the data. ¹²¹: Hidden Markov Models Fundamentals - Stanford University
