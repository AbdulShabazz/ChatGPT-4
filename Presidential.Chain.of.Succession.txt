According to the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution, if the President dies, resigns, or is removed from office, the Vice President becomes the President. The new President would then nominate a new Vice President, who would need to be confirmed by a majority vote of both houses of Congress.

In the case of Joe Biden, if he died shortly after his re-election, Kamala Harris would become the President. She would then nominate a new Vice President, who would need to be confirmed by the Senate. Some possible candidates for the new Vice President include:

* Gretchen Whitmer, the Governor of Michigan
* Tammy Duckworth, the Senator from Illinois
* Catherine Cortez Masto, the Senator from Nevada
* Raphael Warnock, the Senator from Georgia
* Stacey Abrams, the voting rights activist and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate

The new Vice President would be the 49th Vice President of the United States.
