To transfer Bitcoin from your Coinbase account to your bank account, you'll need to sell your Bitcoin for your local currency on Coinbase first, and then withdraw the funds to your bank account. Here’s a general step-by-step guide:

1. **Log in to your Coinbase account**: Go to the Coinbase website or app and sign in.

2. **Navigate to the ‘Assets’ or ‘Portfolio’ section**: This section displays all the cryptocurrencies you hold, including Bitcoin.

3. **Select Bitcoin**: Find Bitcoin from the list of assets and click on it.

4. **Sell Bitcoin**: Look for a “Sell” button or link. When you click it, you’ll have the option to sell your Bitcoin for your local currency. Enter the amount of Bitcoin you wish to sell.

5. **Review the transaction**: Coinbase will show you the details of your sale, including any fees that will be deducted from the sale amount. Make sure everything looks right.

6. **Complete the sale**: Confirm the sale of your Bitcoin. The equivalent amount in your local currency will be credited to your Coinbase cash balance (or a similar account depending on the platform).

7. **Withdraw to your bank account**: Go to your cash balance and find the option to withdraw. Select your bank account (you may need to add one if you haven’t already). Enter the amount you wish to withdraw and confirm.

8. **Wait for the funds to arrive**: Withdrawal times can vary depending on your bank and country, so it may take anywhere from a few minutes to several business days for the funds to appear in your account.

Keep in mind that selling Bitcoin and withdrawing funds to your bank account can involve fees, and the process might slightly vary based on your country or any updates to the Coinbase platform since this guide. It’s always a good idea to check the latest guidelines on the Coinbase website or contact their support for specific instructions tailored to your situation.

If you're unable to cash out or withdraw funds from your Coinbase account, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

1. **Check for Any Restrictions on Your Account**: Sometimes, accounts may be under review or there could be restrictions preventing withdrawals. This could be due to ongoing verification processes or compliance checks. Coinbase usually notifies users of such restrictions via email or through notifications within the app.

2. **Verify Your Account**: Ensure that your account is fully verified. Coinbase requires users to complete various levels of verification to increase their account's withdrawal limits and functionalities. This may include providing photo ID and verifying your phone number and email address.

3. **Check Withdrawal Limits**: You might have reached your daily or weekly withdrawal limit. These limits vary depending on your account level, which is determined by the verification steps you've completed. Review your limits in your account settings.

4. **Review Payment Methods**: Ensure your linked bank account or payment method is correct and has not expired. If there are any issues with your linked bank account, try linking another account or updating your payment method.

5. **Check Network Activity**: Sometimes, delays can be caused by high traffic on the blockchain network or issues with the banking system. These situations are usually temporary.

6. **Update the App or Use the Website**: If you're using the Coinbase app and facing issues, try updating the app to the latest version or accessing your account through the Coinbase website instead.

7. **Contact Support**: If you've tried all the above steps and still can't withdraw your funds, the next step is to contact Coinbase support. Be prepared to provide details about your account and the specific issue you're encountering. Support can be reached through their help center, email, or sometimes via phone for urgent issues.

It's important to remember that withdrawal issues can stem from a variety of reasons, including security measures put in place to protect users' funds. Patiently following the official channels for resolution is usually the best approach.

Coinbase primarily offers customer support through their help center and automated responses for common issues. They emphasize support via their website and support tickets for specific issues. As of my last update, Coinbase had limited direct customer support options like phone or email, and they generally encourage users to use their online help resources.

For urgent matters, particularly those involving account security (like unauthorized account access), Coinbase has provided a phone number for immediate assistance. However, the availability of this phone support can vary by region and time.

Here's how you can seek help:

1. **Help Center**: Visit the Coinbase Help Center online for articles and guides on common issues and questions.

2. **Support Ticket**: If your issue is not resolved through the Help Center, you can submit a support ticket through their website. This process typically involves filling out a form with details about your issue.

3. **Phone Support**: Coinbase has offered a customer support number for urgent issues related to account security. This number has historically been available in select regions and might not be for general support queries. It's best to check the latest on the Coinbase website for an up-to-date phone number and its availability.

4. **Email Support**: Direct email support is not typically advertised for security reasons. Users are encouraged to go through the official channels on the Coinbase website to ensure their query is handled securely and efficiently.

Due to the sensitive nature of account and financial information, it's crucial to only use contact information obtained directly from the official Coinbase website or app. Also, be wary of potential scams impersonating Coinbase support through unofficial channels.
