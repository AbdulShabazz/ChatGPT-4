**Q:** What is the steepest grade allowed on U.S. and North American roads ?

**A:** The steepest grade allowed on U.S. and North American roads varies depending on the type of road and specific regulations. Here are the key points:

### General Roadway Guidelines:
1. **Interstate Highways:**
   - Maximum grade: 6%
   - This limit is designed to ensure safety and efficient movement of vehicles, especially large trucks and heavy vehicles.

2. **Non-Interstate Highways:**
   - Maximum grade: 7-8%
   - This can vary based on specific state regulations and the functional classification of the road.

3. **Local Roads and Streets:**
   - Maximum grade: 10-12%
   - Local jurisdictions have more flexibility, but grades above 10% are typically avoided for safety reasons.

### Mountainous and Terrain-Specific Roads:
1. **Mountain Roads:**
   - Maximum grade: Up to 15% in some cases
   - Designed to accommodate the challenging terrain, but these roads often have lower speed limits and additional safety features like guardrails and warning signs.

### Specific Examples:
1. **Lombard Street, San Francisco:**
   - Grade: Approximately 27%
   - Known for its steep, winding nature and is a tourist attraction rather than a main thoroughfare.

2. **Baldwin Street, New Zealand (for comparison):**
   - Grade: 35%
   - Holds the record for the steepest street in the world, highlighting how extreme grades can exist outside typical regulatory frameworks.

### Safety Considerations:
- Steep grades pose significant challenges for vehicle control, braking, and traction, particularly under adverse weather conditions.
- Roads with grades exceeding standard limits often include safety measures such as:
  - Runaway truck ramps
  - Enhanced signage
  - Speed reduction zones

These guidelines ensure the safety and reliability of road networks across various terrains and jurisdictions in North America.
