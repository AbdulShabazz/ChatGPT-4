**Q:** Which kind of tissue in the Human body is comprised of the fewest cells ?

**A:** The human body has various types of tissues, each with distinct cellular compositions and functions. Among these, the tissue that typically has the fewest cells is connective tissue, specifically the extracellular matrix (ECM) within connective tissues such as bone and cartilage. 

### Key Points:

- **Connective Tissue:**
  - **Extracellular Matrix (ECM):**
    - Consists of a network of macromolecules such as collagen, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins.
    - Provides structural and biochemical support to surrounding cells.
  - **Bone and Cartilage:**
    - **Bone:**
      - Comprised mainly of an ECM with embedded osteocytes (bone cells).
      - The ECM is mineralized, providing rigidity and support.
    - **Cartilage:**
      - Contains a high proportion of ECM relative to the number of chondrocytes (cartilage cells).
      - The ECM is flexible yet firm, supporting mechanical functions.
      
These tissues are primarily composed of ECM, with relatively few cells dispersed within it, making them distinct in their cellular composition compared to other tissues like muscle, nervous, or epithelial tissues, which have a higher cell density.
