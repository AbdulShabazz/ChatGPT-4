Recommend five top comprehensive books on category theory published between 2015-2020.

ChatGPT:

Certainly! Category theory is a mathematical topic that has applications in many areas, particularly in computer science, logic, and abstract algebra. Here are five comprehensive books on category theory from the 2015-2020 timeframe:

    "Basic Category Theory" by Tom Leinster (2014)
        Although it's just outside the requested timeframe, this book is too good to omit. It's an accessible introduction to the subject intended for those who might not necessarily be deep into pure mathematics.

    "Category Theory in Context" by Emily Riehl (2016)
        A rigorous introduction to category theory for graduate students and researchers in mathematics. It covers the basics and then delves deeper into more specialized topics, offering a coherent perspective on the bigger picture in category theory.

    "Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory" by Brendan Fong and David I. Spivak (2018)
        This book focuses on applied category theory, showcasing its potential in other fields of science and engineering. It offers an engaging and practical approach to understanding the topic.

    "Categories for Types" by Roy L. Crole (1993, but still relevant)
        While it predates the time range you mentioned, this book provides an excellent introduction to category theory from a type theory and computer science perspective.

    "An Invitation to Applied Category Theory: Seven Sketches in Compositionality" by Brendan Fong and David I. Spivak (2019)
        A comprehensive look into applied category theory, illustrating its use in areas like databases, systems theory, and quantum mechanics.

Always keep an eye out for newer publications or updated editions, as the field continues to evolve and new materials might offer even deeper insights or more contemporary applications.

What are a few synonyms for 'category theory'?

ChatGPT:

"Category theory" is a unique and specific branch of mathematics, so it doesn't have direct synonyms in the same way that many general English words do. However, there are terms and phrases associated with category theory or which refer to specific aspects or applications of category theory. Some of these include:

    Abstract nonsense - This is a somewhat informal and humorous term used by some mathematicians to refer to category theory, particularly when emphasizing its high level of abstraction.
    General abstract nonsense - Similar to the above, this phrase further underscores the abstract nature of the subject.
    Homological algebra - While not a synonym for category theory, this is a field of algebra that makes extensive use of category theory.
    Categorical logic - Refers to the intersection of category theory with mathematical logic.

That said, when referring to category theory, it's best to use its proper name to avoid confusion, especially in academic and formal settings.

Is categorical homotopy theory related?

ChatGPT:

Yes, categorical homotopy theory is indeed related to category theory. In fact, it's an area of mathematics that merges category theory with homotopy theory.

Homotopy theory is a branch of algebraic topology that studies topological spaces with respect to their continuous deformations, or homotopies. The fundamental concept here is that of paths between points in a topological space, and homotopies between these paths. Two paths are considered homotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other without breaking or leaving the space.

Categorical homotopy theory, on the other hand, generalizes some of these ideas into a categorical setting. For example, in category theory, there are objects and morphisms (or arrows) between these objects. Categorical homotopy theory studies categories where morphisms are analogous to paths in homotopy theory, and where certain diagrams of morphisms can be "homotopically transformed" into other diagrams.

One of the key concepts in categorical homotopy theory is that of a model category, which is a category equipped with three classes of morphisms (weak equivalences, fibrations, and cofibrations) that satisfy certain axioms similar to those in classical homotopy theory.

This area of mathematics allows for the study of homotopical and homological properties using the language and tools of category theory, which can lead to deeper insights and generalizations across various mathematical disciplines.
