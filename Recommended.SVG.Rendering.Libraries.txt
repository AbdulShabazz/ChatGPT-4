Write a basic windows ui in c++20 to display an .svg image without the use of a third party library.

ChatGPT:

Creating a Windows UI application that can display SVG images without third-party libraries is a complex task. SVG files can be quite intricate, and Windows does not provide a native SVG renderer. However, Windows 10+ does provide a basic SVG control in the UWP framework.

Given the constraints, the easiest way might be to leverage the WebView2 (or similar) control, which is essentially a stripped-down browser view. You can display SVG content in this control just as a browser would render SVG. WebView2 is Microsoft's recommended way to embed web content in native apps, but it's essentially based on Microsoft Edge (Chromium).

Here's a very simplified outline of what you'd have to do:

    Setup a basic Win32 Window.

    Initialize WebView2 control in the window.

    Load SVG content into WebView2.

Below is a skeleton of the setup. Note that this assumes you've installed and set up the WebView2 SDK:

```cpp

#include <windows.h>
#include <wil/com.h>
#include <webview2.h>

wil::com_ptr<IWebView2Environment> webViewEnvironment;
wil::com_ptr<IWebView2WebView> webView;

LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) {
    switch (uMsg) {
    case WM_DESTROY:
        PostQuitMessage(0);
        return 0;
    }

    return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}

int CALLBACK WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE, LPSTR, int nCmdShow) {
    const wchar_t CLASS_NAME[] = L"Sample Window Class";
    WNDCLASS wc = {};

    wc.lpfnWndProc = WindowProc;
    wc.hInstance = hInstance;
    wc.lpszClassName = CLASS_NAME;

    RegisterClass(&wc);

    HWND hwnd = CreateWindowEx(
        0,
        CLASS_NAME,
        L"SVG Viewer",
        WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,
        CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        hInstance,
        NULL
    );

    if (hwnd == NULL) {
        return 0;
    }

    ShowWindow(hwnd, nCmdShow);

    // Initialize WebView2 for this window...
    CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentWithOptions(nullptr, nullptr, nullptr,
        Callback<IWebView2CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentCompletedHandler>(
            [hwnd](HRESULT result, IWebView2Environment* env) -> HRESULT {
                env->CreateCoreWebView2Controller(hwnd, Callback<IWebView2CreateCoreWebView2ControllerCompletedHandler>(
                    [hwnd](HRESULT result, IWebView2Controller* controller) -> HRESULT {
                        if (controller != nullptr) {
                            wil::com_ptr<IWebView2Controller> webController = controller;
                            webController->get_CoreWebView2(&webView);
                            
                            // Load SVG here. For simplicity, we're using inline SVG string.
                            webView->Navigate(L"data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg viewBox='0 0 100 100' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'><circle cx='50' cy='50' r='40'/></svg>");
                        }
                        return S_OK;
                    }).Get());
                return S_OK;
            }).Get());

    MSG msg = {};
    while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
        TranslateMessage(&msg);
        DispatchMessage(&msg);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Remember that this is a simplified example and does not handle all the necessary error-checking and other intricacies. Also, while WebView2 isn't exactly a third-party library, it's not bundled with C++ or the Windows SDK by default; you'll need to set it up.

If you truly wish to parse and render SVGs natively without any web-based or third-party tools, you would need to write or integrate an SVG parser and renderer, which would be a huge undertaking.

User:

Is there a third party library that you would recommend?

ChatGPT:

Yes, if you're open to using third-party libraries, several excellent options are tailored for SVG rendering in C++ applications:

    NanoSVG:
        Description: A small and simple SVG parse library written in C. It's great for lightweight applications that need basic SVG rendering without all the bells and whistles.
        Link: https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg

    libsvgtiny:
        Description: A lightweight library for rendering SVGs. It's a part of the NetSurf project and can render a subset of SVGs.
        Link: Part of the NetSurf project. You might have to dig into their repositories to extract just the libsvgtiny.

    Qt SVG:
        Description: If you're using the Qt framework for your application, it comes with a module for SVG rendering. Qt is a full-fledged UI framework, so it might be overkill if you just need SVG rendering.
        Link: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtsvg-index.html

    Cairo:
        Description: A 2D graphics library that supports SVG among many other formats. It's a bit lower-level, so it might have a steeper learning curve than some of the other options.
        Link: https://www.cairographics.org/

    Resvg:
        Description: A Rust library, but it has C-API bindings. It aims to be a high-quality SVG rendering library.
        Link: https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg

Of these, the choice largely depends on your specific needs:

    For lightweight applications or if you need only basic SVG rendering, NanoSVG or libsvgtiny could be perfect.

    If you're already working with or are familiar with the Qt framework, Qt SVG would integrate seamlessly.

    For high-quality rendering and more extensive SVG support, Resvg might be the way to go, though integrating a Rust library might have its challenges.

    Cairo is robust and offers a lot of functionalities beyond SVG rendering. It might be a good choice if you need more than just SVG support.

Always remember to check the licenses of third-party libraries to ensure they are compatible with your project's licensing and distribution needs.
