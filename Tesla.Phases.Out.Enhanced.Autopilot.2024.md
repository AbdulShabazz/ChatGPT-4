Q: Why did Tesla eliminate enhanced auto pilot ?

A: Tesla's decision to eliminate the "Enhanced Autopilot" option from their offerings can be attributed to several strategic and business considerations:

1. **Simplification of Options**: Tesla has been known to streamline its product offerings periodically. By reducing the number of available options, Tesla simplifies the purchase process for consumers and can streamline its own production and software development processes.

2. **Focus on Full Self-Driving (FSD)**: Tesla has been pushing its Full Self-Driving capability as a major selling point and future revenue stream. By phasing out Enhanced Autopilot, Tesla may be encouraging more customers to opt for the more expensive FSD package, which promises more advanced features.

3. **Cost and Value Perception**: The features of Enhanced Autopilot were increasingly overlapping with those offered in the Full Self-Driving package. Customers might have found Enhanced Autopilot to be less valuable as more capabilities were incorporated into the FSD package, making the latter seem like a better investment.

4. **Regulatory Considerations**: As regulations around autonomous driving evolve, Tesla might find it more efficient to focus on fewer, more advanced autonomous driving options that they believe will comply with future regulatory standards.

5. **Market Strategy**: Removing Enhanced Autopilot could also be a strategic move to differentiate Teslaâ€™s offerings from competitors. Focusing on a single, more advanced autonomous driving package might position Tesla as a leader in high-end autonomous technology.

These factors likely contributed to Tesla's decision to phase out the Enhanced Autopilot option and focus more on promoting their Full Self-Driving capability.

Q: Enhanced auto-pilot was free equipment which I felt previewed the capability of FSD without the requirement of a subscription. Now Tesla expects people to make a "cold" purchase o the add-on technology without a complementary form of trial package? It's folly!

A: It's understandable to feel frustrated by the removal of a feature that allowed you to experience some of the capabilities of Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology without the full cost. Many customers appreciate having a trial or preview feature like Enhanced Autopilot to evaluate the technology before committing to a more expensive package.

With Enhanced Autopilot, users could experience advanced features like automatic lane changes, autopark, and summon, which could make the decision to upgrade to FSD seem more worthwhile after experiencing these benefits firsthand. Removing this "stepping stone" feature could indeed make it harder for customers to justify the significant investment required for FSD without firsthand experience of its benefits.

Your point about the lack of a trial package is particularly valid in the tech industry, where trial periods are common practice to build consumer trust and demonstrate value. Tesla's strategy might reflect a confidence in their product's appeal or a focus on monetizing their technology more aggressively. However, it also runs the risk of alienating potential buyers who are hesitant to purchase technology they haven't been able to test.

Feedback like yours is important and could influence how Tesla and similar companies structure their offerings in the future. If enough customers share your perspective, it could encourage Tesla to reconsider how they allow potential buyers to experience their advanced technologies before making a purchase.
