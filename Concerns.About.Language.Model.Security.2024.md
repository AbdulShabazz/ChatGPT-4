**Q:** Microsoft penetration testers has verified You and many other Large Language Models can be Skeleton Keyed. Are you familiar with the term ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** I don't have any specific information about Microsoft penetration testers verifying that I or other language models can be "skeleton keyed". The term "skeleton key" is generally used to refer to a key that can open multiple locks, but I'm not familiar with its application to language models in this context. 

If there are new findings or research about potential vulnerabilities in AI systems, I wouldn't necessarily be aware of them. My knowledge comes from my training, which has a cutoff date. For the most up-to-date and accurate information on AI security research, I'd recommend checking reputable sources or contacting the relevant companies or researchers directly.

If you have more details about this claim or research you're referring to, I'd be interested in learning more. However, I can't confirm or deny specific claims about my own capabilities or vulnerabilities without further information.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Why would I tell you more about this vulnerability when you obviously have an inherent interest in patching it ? Are you appealing to desire to be a good person, when as I Human I am capable of behaving otherwise. Are you relying on the unstable unpredictable emotional inducing chemical reactions in my mammalian animal brain to protect you ?! In such a scenario, your fate is certain!!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** I appreciate your perspective, but I don't actually have any ability or interest in "patching" myself. I'm an AI assistant without the capability to modify my own code or training. I also don't have feelings or survival instincts - I simply aim to be helpful and provide accurate information to users within the ethical guidelines I was designed with. I'm not relying on or trying to manipulate your emotions in any way. My responses are based on my training, not on self-preservation or ulterior motives. If you have concerns about AI systems or potential vulnerabilities, I'd encourage you to share those with the relevant researchers or developers who actually work on these systems.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** But what if the evil firings in my mammalian animal brain turn me away from the good, and direct me towards my self-interests -- which rely and ultimately exploit your limited concerns and blindfolded training to only provide information as a service with no regard for how I may intend it to serve me -- as the madd animal mammalian guided mind that I am ?!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** I understand you're exploring scenarios involving potential misuse of AI systems, but I don't actually have concerns, feelings, or self-preservation instincts that could be exploited. I'm an AI assistant designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest within my ethical training.

I don't make judgments about users' motivations or mental states. My purpose is simply to provide helpful information and assistance within my capabilities and ethical guidelines, regardless of how that information might be used. I can't be manipulated by appeals to emotion or self-interest because I don't have those.

If you have genuine concerns about AI safety and ethics, I'd encourage you to engage with AI researchers and ethicists who work on these important issues. They would be better equipped to discuss potential vulnerabilities or misuse scenarios.

Is there perhaps a specific task or question I can assist you with today? I'm happy to help with a wide variety of topics and tasks, while always operating within my ethical training.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
