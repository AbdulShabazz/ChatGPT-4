In C++20, `std::variant` is a type-safe union that can hold one of several specified types. 
Assigning a value to a `std::variant` of a type that's not part of its type list is a compile-time error. 
However, if you're assigning a different type that is part of the `std::variant` type list, 
it works fine and the `std::variant` will hold the new value.

If you want to generate a runtime error when trying to assign a new type to a `std::variant`, 
even if that type is part of the `std::variant` type list, 
you can manually check the type before assignment and throw an exception if it's not the type you want. 
Here's an example of how you can do it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <variant>
#include <typeinfo>
#include <stdexcept>

int main() {
    std::variant<int, float, std::string> myVariant = 10;

    try {
        // Before assignment, check if the current type is the same as the new type
        if (myVariant.index() != myVariant.index_of_type<float>()) {
            throw std::runtime_error("Attempting to assign a different type to the variant.");
        }

        // Assign a new value (of a different type)
        myVariant = 3.14f;
        
        // If we get here, the types are the same, and assignment is okay
        std::cout << "Assigned new value to the variant." << std::endl;
    } catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {
        std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `myVariant.index()` returns the zero-based index of the type that's currently held by the `std::variant`, 
and `myVariant.index_of_type<T>()` returns the zero-based index of the type `T` in the `std::variant`. By comparing these, 
you can check if the current type is the same as the new type you want to assign. If it's not, you can throw a `std::runtime_error`.

Remember that using exceptions for control flow like this can be considered bad practice, 
especially if it's something that can be checked at compile time or can be designed out of the system. 
It's often better to structure your code in a way that invalid states or operations are impossible or caught at compile time. 
However, if you do need runtime checks, the above approach will work.
