To generate and plot a complex spectrogram from an audio `.wav` file in Python, you would typically use libraries such as `librosa` for audio processing and `matplotlib` for plotting. Below is a step-by-step guide with a code example:

1. **Load the Audio File**: Use `librosa.load` to read the `.wav` file. This function returns the audio data as a time series and the sampling rate.

2. **Compute the STFT**: The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is computed to obtain the complex spectrogram, which contains both magnitude and phase information.

3. **Plot the Spectrogram**:
   - Plot the magnitude part of the spectrogram using `librosa.display.specshow` which is suitable for magnitude spectrograms.
   - Plot the phase part of the spectrogram separately, typically by calculating the angle of the complex numbers obtained from the STFT.

Here is an example Python script that demonstrates this process:

```python
import librosa
import librosa.display
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Load the Audio File
# Replace 'path_to_file.wav' with the path to your audio file
audio_file_path = 'path_to_file.wav'
y, sr = librosa.load(audio_file_path, sr=None)  # 'sr=None' loads the file with its original sampling rate

# Step 2: Compute the STFT
# 'n_fft' is the window size, 'hop_length' is the number of samples between successive frames
n_fft = 2048
hop_length = 512
stft = librosa.stft(y, n_fft=n_fft, hop_length=hop_length)

# Step 3: Plot the Magnitude Spectrogram
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))

# Magnitude plot
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
mag = librosa.amplitude_to_db(np.abs(stft), ref=np.max)  # Convert the magnitude to decibel
librosa.display.specshow(mag, sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length, x_axis='time', y_axis='log', cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar(format='%+2.0f dB')
plt.title('Magnitude Spectrogram')

# Phase plot
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
phase = np.angle(stft)  # Extract the phase information
librosa.display.specshow(phase, sr=sr, hop_length=hop_length, x_axis='time', y_axis='log', cmap='viridis')
plt.colorbar()
plt.title('Phase Spectrogram')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Replace `'path_to_file.wav'` with the actual path to your `.wav` file.

In this code:

- `n_fft` represents the window size used for the Fourier Transform.
- `hop_length` is the number of samples between successive frames; a smaller `hop_length` provides a finer time resolution.

The magnitude part of the spectrogram is converted to decibels, which is a common practice to visualize the dynamic range more effectively. The phase spectrogram is plotted directly as angles (in radians) which range from \(-\pi\) to \(+\pi\).

After running this script, you should see two plots. The first plot is the magnitude spectrogram displaying the intensity of frequencies over time, and the second plot is the phase spectrogram showing the phase information at each point in the time-frequency domain.

Please ensure that you have the required libraries installed in your Python environment before running the script. You can install them using `pip` if needed:

```sh
pip install librosa matplotlib
```

This example provides a basic complex spectrogram visualization. For more advanced analysis or improved visualization, additional processing and fine-tuning of the parameters may be required.
