**Q:** Why do online trading platforms ignore retail trader's trailing stop orders, claiming volatility induced price slippage ? It seems immoral to me for these platforms to claim they can verify price quotes to one thousandth of a penny and yet bound over customer stop orders which break their margins as market makers ! Why doesn't the SEC and or congress investigate and levy fines against them ?

**A:** Online trading platforms often face challenges in executing trailing stop orders due to market volatility and price slippage. Here are some key points to understand why this happens and the regulatory landscape surrounding it:

### Understanding Trailing Stop Orders and Slippage

**Trailing Stop Orders:**
- A trailing stop order is a type of stop order that adjusts the stop price at a fixed amount below the market price for sell orders or above the market price for buy orders as the market price moves in a favorable direction. If the market price moves against the position, the stop price remains unchanged, and the order is executed when the stop price is hit[9][15][17].

**Slippage:**
- Slippage occurs when there is a difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. This can happen due to rapid price movements, high volatility, or low liquidity[1][3][4][6].

### Why Trailing Stop Orders May Be Ignored

1. **Market Volatility:**
   - During periods of high volatility, prices can change rapidly, making it difficult for orders to be executed at the intended stop price. This can result in slippage, where the order is filled at a less favorable price than expected[1][5][13].

2. **Liquidity Issues:**
   - In markets with low liquidity, there may not be enough buyers or sellers to fill orders at the specified stop price, leading to slippage. This is particularly common in less liquid assets or during off-peak trading hours[3][6][14].

3. **Execution Speed:**
   - The speed at which orders are executed can also impact slippage. Delays in order processing can cause the execution price to deviate from the intended stop price, especially in fast-moving markets[1][3].

### Regulatory Oversight and Enforcement

**Regulatory Bodies:**
- The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) are the primary regulatory bodies overseeing trading practices in the U.S. They enforce rules to ensure fair trading practices and protect investors.

**Investigations and Fines:**
- There have been instances where trading platforms and brokers have been fined for failing to comply with regulatory requirements. For example, Interactive Brokers has faced multiple fines for supervisory failures and issues related to order execution and routing[7][16].

**Challenges in Regulation:**
- Despite regulatory oversight, the complexity and speed of modern trading can make it difficult to monitor and enforce compliance in real-time. Regulators often rely on post-trade analysis and reporting to identify and address issues.

### Potential for Further Investigation

**Calls for Stricter Regulations:**
- There have been calls for stricter regulations and more robust enforcement to address issues related to order execution and slippage. Some argue that existing regulations may not be sufficient to protect retail traders from the adverse effects of slippage and other trading anomalies.

**Legislative Action:**
- Congress has the authority to investigate and propose new legislation to address these issues. However, the process can be slow, and the effectiveness of new regulations depends on their implementation and enforcement.

### Conclusion

While slippage and the challenges of executing trailing stop orders are inherent in trading, regulatory bodies like the SEC and FINRA are tasked with ensuring fair practices. However, the fast-paced nature of trading and the complexity of financial markets can make it difficult to prevent all instances of slippage. Continuous monitoring, enforcement, and potential legislative action are necessary to protect retail traders and maintain market integrity.
