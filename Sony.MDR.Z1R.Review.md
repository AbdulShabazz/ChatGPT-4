# Sony MDR-Z1R Headphone Review

Excellent audio experience, with awesome detail retrieval delivered from these dynamic audio drivers;  its low-end presence is only rivaled by Focal Utopia, Abyss 1266 and a few well-known others.

But a sticking point which confuses me relates to the device's performance specs. Sony quotes a frequency response for these dynamic drivers from 4 Hz to 120 KHz. That's incredible!! But other planar magnetic driver-based headphones I've heard such as the Hifiman Susvara which only has a measured frequency response from 6 Hz to 75 KHz has more clarity and sounds more detailed. How's that even possible?! Its diaphragm is not as fast!!

So now I wonder about Sony's quoted specs, and how their dynamic driver can have a very fast transient response which is required to reach the 120 KHz band yet not sound as detailed as the Susvara and how this is possible and if maybe Sony specs are misleading.

Regarding performance specs, the Hifiman Susvara notedly has a lower sensitivity and a higher impedance, when compared to the Sony, which as a result requires more power to drive it to the same sound pressure levels (SPLs) as the Sony. However this higher voltage may afford the Susvara more precise control over the placement of the diaphragm, thereby giving it a more accurate transient response, and thus superior detail retrieval across its spectrum. 

Planar magnetic headphones have their own performance issues though, such as pronounced insufficient low-end presence in the sub 200 Hz band without the use of $$$$ high end audio amplifier equipment. We're talking thousands of dollars ie. Pass Labs; Hifiman -Serenade, -Prelude; Burson Audio Voyager...

So does this make the Sony MDR-Z1R overpriced, or its specs misleading? By no means. But there is still A LOT to learn about what companies actually are communicating in their performance measurements.
