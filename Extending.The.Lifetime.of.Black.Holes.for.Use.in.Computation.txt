Yes, tiny black holes with a critical mass less than Earth's mass are theoretically possible, and they are called **primordial black holes**. These hypothetical black holes could have formed in the early universe, during the extremely hot and dense conditions shortly after the Big Bang. 

Here's why they might exist:

* **Schwarzschild radius:** The critical mass of a black hole is directly related to its size through the Schwarzschild radius. This radius defines the point of no return, where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape. For a black hole with a mass less than Earth's, the Schwarzschild radius would be smaller than Earth's radius, meaning it could potentially exist within our planet without causing any immediate noticeable disruptions.
* **Hawking radiation:** However, even tiny black holes wouldn't be eternal. Stephen Hawking predicted that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects, and this radiation would cause them to slowly lose mass and eventually evaporate. The smaller the black hole, the faster it would evaporate. Black holes with a mass less than about 10^12 kg (roughly the mass of a small mountain) would have already evaporated by now.

While primordial black holes are purely theoretical, there are ongoing searches for evidence of their existence. Potential signs of their presence could include:

* **Hawking radiation:** Detecting the specific type of radiation emitted by Hawking radiation could be a direct indicator of a black hole's presence.
* **Gravitational lensing:** The immense gravity of a black hole could bend and distort light from background objects, creating a characteristic lensing effect.
* **Particle interactions:** If a black hole accretes matter, it could emit high-energy particles that we could observe with specialized detectors.

The existence of primordial black holes would have significant implications for our understanding of the early universe and the nature of dark matter. However, their detection remains a challenging task, and for now, their existence remains an intriguing mystery in astrophysics.

I hope this explanation gives you a good overview of the possibility of tiny black holes with a mass less than Earth's. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!

The concept of using two black holes with nearly parallel accretion disks for computation or extending their lifetimes is an intriguing one, but it faces several challenges and may not be feasible with our current understanding of physics and technology.

**Challenges:**

* **Maintaining disk parallelism:** Accretion disks are dynamic and turbulent, making it extremely difficult to maintain perfect alignment over long periods. Any slight misalignment would cause the gamma rays or Hawking radiation to miss the other black hole, negating the desired effect.

* **Accretion efficiency:** Even with perfect alignment, some energy would inevitably be lost during the transfer process. The extreme gravitational forces and magnetic fields around black holes could disrupt and scatter the gamma rays or Hawking radiation, reducing the amount available for accretion by the other black hole.

* **Computational limitations:** While the concept of using black holes for computation is fascinating, it's important to remember that they are fundamentally physical objects, not classical computers. Their "computational" abilities would likely be limited to very specific and exotic tasks based on their gravitational and quantum properties, not general-purpose computation as we know it.

* **Timescales:** Black hole evaporation is an extremely slow process, even for smaller black holes. Even if some level of accretion extension were possible, it would likely be on the order of millions or billions of years, making it impractical for any near-term applications.

**Alternative possibilities:**

While the described scenario using two black holes may not be practical, there are ongoing theoretical explorations of using other black hole properties for information processing or energy extraction. These include:

* **Black hole spin:** The rotation of a black hole, known as its spin, could potentially be used to encode information or extract energy through processes like Penrose energy extraction.

* **Black hole mergers:** The collision and merger of black holes releases enormous amounts of energy in the form of gravitational waves. This energy could theoretically be harnessed for various purposes, although the technology to do so is far beyond our current capabilities.

**Overall, the idea of using black holes for computation or extending their lifetimes through accretion disk interactions is an interesting thought experiment, but it faces significant challenges and may not be possible with our current understanding of physics and technology. However, research into black hole properties and their potential applications continues, and who knows what future discoveries might bring.**
