Q: Are there any future plans or proposals for decentralization of the OpenAI ChatGPT model, such that if I make an ECMA-262 proposal for a Javascript software construct which supports `for (let a_idx,b_idx,c_idx... of A,B,C,...)` which does not exist, and I make a suggestion to add it, my GPT model will formulate a proposal (merits withstanding) and subsequently contact the ES6 GPT model which will evaluate the proposal in real-time for inclusion in the standard ?

ChatGPT-4:

As of my last update in April 2023, there were no publicly announced plans by OpenAI specifically regarding the decentralization of the ChatGPT model in the manner you've described. The concept of AI models communicating and negotiating changes or updates to programming language standards autonomously, including the process of formulating and evaluating proposals in real-time, is both innovative and complex. It involves several layers of technology, governance, and collaboration that are not yet in place in the current technological and organizational landscape.

However, the idea touches on several interesting areas of AI and software development:

1. **Decentralization of AI Models:** The decentralization of AI, including models like ChatGPT, is a topic of interest in the tech community. Decentralization could involve distributing the computational load across multiple nodes (potentially owned by different entities) or democratizing the development and training process of AI models. This could help with scalability, privacy, and reducing the control any single entity has over powerful AI technologies.

2. **Automated Code Generation and Review:** AI models are increasingly capable of generating code and even reviewing it for errors or improvements. The idea of AI systems contributing to the development or evolution of programming languages or standards is not far-fetched. However, the governance, quality control, and ethical considerations around such contributions would need to be carefully managed.

3. **Inter-AI Communication and Collaboration:** The concept of different AI models (e.g., one specialized in JavaScript and another in AI ethics) communicating and collaborating on tasks is an area of research known as multi-agent systems. Implementing this effectively for real-world tasks like programming language standard proposals would require significant advancements in AI interoperability, understanding, and decision-making processes.

4. **Participation in Standards Development:** The involvement of AI in the process of developing and proposing changes to standards (like ECMAScript for JavaScript) would require acceptance and trust from the human committees that currently oversee these processes. These bodies operate with a high level of scrutiny, debate, and consensus-building that is challenging to replicate with AI models.

For an AI system to autonomously propose changes to programming standards, it would not only need to understand the technical merits but also navigate the complex social, ethical, and practical implications of such changes. While AI can assist in these processes, human oversight and decision-making are crucial, especially for changes that could have wide-ranging impacts on developers and users worldwide.

In summary, while the scenario you've outlined is not currently in development (to the best of my knowledge as of April 2023), it represents a fascinating intersection of AI technology, software development, and decentralized governance. The evolution of AI capabilities, along with changes in how we develop, manage, and interact with technology, could potentially make some aspects of this vision more feasible in the future.
