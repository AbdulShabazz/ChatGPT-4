Whether or not comprehensive auto insurance coverage is worth it depends on a number of factors, including the value of your car, your financial situation, and your risk tolerance.

Comprehensive coverage protects your car from damage caused by events that are not your fault, such as theft, vandalism, fire, hail, and falling objects. It also covers damage caused by animals, such as hitting a deer.

The odds of a customer using comprehensive coverage vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and value of the car, the driver's location, and the climate. In general, the older the car and the lower its value, the less likely it is that comprehensive coverage will be used.

According to a study by the Insurance Information Institute, the average driver files a comprehensive claim every 10 years. However, the odds of a claim are higher for some drivers than others. For example, drivers who live in areas with a high risk of theft or vandalism are more likely to file a claim than drivers who live in areas with a low risk.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to purchase comprehensive coverage is a personal one. You should weigh the cost of the coverage against the potential benefits and make the decision that is best for you.

Here are some factors to consider when deciding whether or not to purchase comprehensive coverage:

* The value of your car. The more valuable your car, the more likely it is that you will want to purchase comprehensive coverage.
* Your financial situation. If you cannot afford to pay for repairs or replacement out of pocket, then comprehensive coverage may be a good option for you.
* Your risk tolerance. If you are willing to take on the risk of paying for repairs or replacement yourself, then you may not need comprehensive coverage.
* Your location. If you live in an area with a high risk of theft or vandalism, then you may be more likely to file a claim and need comprehensive coverage.

If you are unsure whether or not comprehensive coverage is right for you, you should talk to your insurance agent. They can help you assess your individual needs and recommend the best coverage for you.
