Can training future OpenAI LLMs on prior ChatGPT responses provide better models?

ChatGPT:

Training future OpenAI large language models (LLMs) on prior ChatGPT responses could provide some benefits, but it also has challenges:

    Benefits:
        Consistency: Using prior responses can help in achieving consistent answers across different versions of the model.
        Reinforcement: If a certain answer was correct and effective in one context, training on that response could reinforce the information for future queries.
        Customization: If the goal is to create domain-specific models, training on prior responses from that domain could help in refining the model's knowledge for that particular domain.

    Challenges:
        Reinforcing Errors: If a previous response was incorrect or suboptimal, training on it might reinforce the mistake in future models.
        Overfitting: There's a risk of overfitting to the specific style and content of the prior responses, which might reduce the model's capacity to generate diverse and novel answers.
        Data Contamination: ChatGPT responses often include user prompts. If not carefully curated, there's a risk of including personal or sensitive data from user queries.

In conclusion, while it could be beneficial to train on prior ChatGPT responses, it's crucial to curate and preprocess this data carefully to maximize the benefits and minimize the potential challenges.
