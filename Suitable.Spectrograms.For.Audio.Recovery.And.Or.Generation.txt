For audio file recovery and generation, the most suitable spectrogram format would ideally preserve as much information as possible from the original signal, particularly the phase information which is crucial for an accurate reconstruction. The following spectrogram formats can be considered, each with their advantages and limitations:

1. **Linear-Frequency Spectrogram (Magnitude and Phase)**:
   - This format uses the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to create a two-dimensional representation of the signal where the frequency bins are linearly spaced.
   - It preserves both magnitude and phase information, enabling more accurate reconstruction of the original signal.
   - However, it is less compact than Mel spectrograms and less aligned with human auditory perception.

2. **Complex Spectrogram**:
   - The complex spectrogram is the output of the STFT before any magnitude or phase extraction and includes both information intrinsically.
   - It provides the most complete representation of the signal and allows for the best audio recovery since it retains all the original information that can be captured by the STFT.
   - This format is ideal for perfect reconstruction if the exact inverse process is applied.

3. **Mel Spectrogram**:
   - A Mel spectrogram represents the power spectrum of a sound mapped onto the Mel scale, which is a perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance from one another.
   - It is not suitable for perfect reconstruction due to the lossy conversion process, which includes warping the frequency scale and often discarding phase information.
   - Mel spectrograms are more commonly used for machine learning applications where human-like perception is more important than reconstruction fidelity.

4. **Log-Mel Spectrogram**:
   - This format takes the Mel spectrogram and applies a logarithmic scaling to the amplitude.
   - Like the Mel spectrogram, it is even less suited to reconstruction due to the additional logarithmic transformation, but it is highly useful in audio classification tasks.

5. **Constant-Q Transform (CQT) Spectrogram**:
   - The CQT is a time-frequency representation where the frequency bins are geometrically spaced based on a logarithmic division of the octave.
   - This gives a more musically-informed representation, particularly useful for tasks like music analysis.
   - While not as lossy as the Mel spectrogram, it still presents challenges for reconstruction due to its logarithmic nature.

6. **Gammatone Spectrogram**:
   - It mimics the human auditory system even more closely than the Mel scale by using a bank of Gammatone filters, which are modeled after the human cochlea.
   - It is primarily used in psychoacoustic research and speech processing but is not typically used for reconstruction due to its complex and lossy representation.

For the most accurate audio file recovery and generation, the best choice is the complex spectrogram since it retains the complete information from the original audio signal, including both magnitude and phase. The complex spectrogram can be directly inverted using the inverse STFT (ISTFT) to perfectly reconstruct the original signal, given that no information is discarded during processing.

In summary, the spectrogram format selection is dependent on the specific application requirements. For accurate audio recovery and generation, complex spectrograms or linear-frequency spectrograms with magnitude and phase information are recommended. For applications in machine learning and audio classification where human perception is more relevant, Mel spectrograms or log-Mel spectrograms may be preferred, with the trade-off of reconstruction fidelity.
