**Q:** How do I update which companies have access to data sharing of my accounts through Plaid ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** To update which companies have access to your account data through Plaid, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Plaid Portal: Visit https://my.plaid.com and log in using the email address associated with your Plaid account.

2. Navigate to "Manage Connections": Once logged in, you will see an overview of your connected accounts and the companies that have access to your data.

3. Review Connected Apps: Look through the list of apps and companies that are currently connected to your account(s) via Plaid.

4. Disconnect Apps: If you want to revoke access for a particular app or company, click on the "Disconnect" button next to the app's name. This will prevent the app from accessing your account data in the future.

5. Confirm Disconnection: After clicking "Disconnect," you may be asked to confirm your action. Click "Disconnect" again to finalize the process.

6. Repeat as Necessary: If you wish to disconnect multiple apps, repeat steps 4 and 5 for each app you want to remove access from.

Remember that disconnecting an app through Plaid does not necessarily close your account with that app or company; it only revokes their ability to access your financial data through Plaid. If you wish to completely close your account with a particular service, you should contact them directly or follow their account closure process.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Do companies which once had access to these accounts through Plaid still have access once data sharing is removed ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Once you have disconnected an app or company from your Plaid account, they will no longer have access to your financial data through Plaid. This means that the app will not be able to retrieve any new data or updates from your connected financial institutions.

However, it's important to note that disconnecting an app through Plaid does not automatically delete any data that the app may have previously accessed and stored on their own servers. The app's retention and use of your historical data would depend on their own data privacy policies and practices.

If you want to ensure that a company completely deletes your data from their records, you should contact them directly and request data deletion in accordance with their privacy policy and applicable laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), if relevant to your situation.

In summary, while disconnecting an app through Plaid prevents future access to your financial data, it does not guarantee the deletion of historical data already obtained by the app. For complete data removal, you must contact the company directly.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
