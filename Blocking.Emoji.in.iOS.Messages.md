**Q:** How can you block emoji in text SMS and MMS messages on iOS

**A:** To block emoji in text SMS and MMS messages on iOS, you can use the built-in Screen Time feature. Here's how:

1. Open the Settings app on your iOS device.
2. Tap on Screen Time.
3. If you haven't set up Screen Time before, tap "Turn On Screen Time" and follow the prompts to enable it.
4. Tap on "Content & Privacy Restrictions."
5. If it's not already enabled, tap the toggle switch to turn on Content & Privacy Restrictions.
6. Tap on "Content Restrictions."
7. Scroll down and tap on "Keyboard."
8. Under "Keyboard," you will see an option for "Add-ons." Tap on it.
9. Toggle off the switch next to "Emoji."

After following these steps, emoji will be blocked from appearing in the keyboard when composing SMS and MMS messages. However, it's important to note that this will also disable emoji across the entire device, not just in the Messages app.

Unfortunately, as of iOS 16, there is no built-in way to selectively block emoji only in the Messages app while allowing them in other apps. You may need to use a third-party keyboard app that allows more granular control over emoji if you want to block them only in specific apps.
