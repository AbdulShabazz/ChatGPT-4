**Q:** What is Windows Hypervisor Platform and when should i enable it ?

**A:** The Windows Hypervisor Platform (WHP) is a virtualization framework for Windows that allows third-party virtualization software to leverage the hypervisor capabilities of Windows. It is primarily used to provide hardware virtualization features to applications and enhance performance and compatibility of virtual machines (VMs).

## Key Features of Windows Hypervisor Platform:
- **Hypervisor-Based Security**: WHP allows applications to utilize hardware virtualization features to run VMs with improved security and isolation.
- **Third-Party Virtualization Support**: Enables third-party virtualization software (such as VMware, VirtualBox) to use the built-in Windows hypervisor instead of their own.
- **Enhanced Performance**: By leveraging hardware virtualization, WHP can improve the performance of VMs and the host system.
- **Compatibility with Windows Features**: WHP ensures better integration and compatibility with various Windows features and security mechanisms, such as Device Guard and Credential Guard.

## When to Enable Windows Hypervisor Platform:
- **Running Third-Party Virtualization Software**: If you are using virtualization software like VMware Workstation or Oracle VirtualBox, enabling WHP can improve performance and compatibility.
- **Using Windows Sandbox**: Windows Sandbox relies on WHP to create a lightweight, isolated virtual environment for running untrusted applications.
- **Developing or Testing Hypervisor-Based Applications**: If you are developing or testing applications that require hypervisor-level access, enabling WHP can provide the necessary environment.
- **Enhanced Security Needs**: If you require advanced security features like Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI) or Virtualization-Based Security (VBS), WHP is necessary.

## How to Enable Windows Hypervisor Platform:
1. **Open Windows Features**: 
   - Go to `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Turn Windows features on or off`.
   - Alternatively, search for "Windows Features" in the Start menu.

2. **Enable WHP**: 
   - In the Windows Features window, check the box next to "Windows Hypervisor Platform."
   - Click `OK` and restart your computer to apply the changes.

## Considerations:
- **Hardware Requirements**: Ensure your system supports hardware virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) and that it is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI.
- **Compatibility Issues**: Some older virtualization software may have compatibility issues with WHP enabled. Ensure you are using the latest versions of your virtualization software.
- **Performance Impact**: While WHP can improve VM performance, it may also increase resource usage on the host system. Monitor system performance and adjust settings as necessary.

Enabling Windows Hypervisor Platform can provide significant benefits for virtualization and security, but it should be done with consideration of your specific use case and system requirements.

**Q:** Does Windows Sandbox inherently enable Windows Hypervisor or must this feature be explicitly enabled ?

**A:** Windows Sandbox inherently relies on the Windows Hypervisor Platform to function, but enabling Windows Sandbox will automatically enable the necessary hypervisor features. Here is a detailed explanation:

## Enabling Windows Sandbox:

1. **Open Windows Features**:
   - Go to `Control Panel` -> `Programs` -> `Turn Windows features on or off`.
   - Alternatively, search for "Windows Features" in the Start menu.

2. **Enable Windows Sandbox**:
   - In the Windows Features window, check the box next to "Windows Sandbox."
   - Click `OK` and restart your computer to apply the changes.

When you enable Windows Sandbox, the Windows Hypervisor Platform and other necessary virtualization features are automatically enabled as part of the process. You do not need to explicitly enable the Windows Hypervisor Platform separately.

## Requirements and Considerations:

- **Hardware Requirements**: Ensure your system supports hardware virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) and that it is enabled in the BIOS/UEFI.
- **Windows Edition**: Windows Sandbox is available on Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions.
- **System Resources**: Ensure your system has adequate resources (CPU, RAM, disk space) to run Windows Sandbox effectively.

Enabling Windows Sandbox simplifies the process as it automatically configures the required hypervisor settings, making it straightforward for users to create and use isolated virtual environments without manually configuring the underlying virtualization features.
