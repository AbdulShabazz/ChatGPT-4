Apple does not currently have a lease program that allows you to subscribe to the latest iPhone model hardware until a new hardware model is released. However, they do have an iPhone Upgrade Program that allows you to finance the purchase of an iPhone over 24 months with 0% APR. After 12 or 24 months, you can then trade in your iPhone for a new one and start a new installment plan.

Apple also offers a business financing program that includes lease options for businesses. However, these leases are typically for longer terms than the iPhone Upgrade Program and may require a down payment.

It is possible that Apple may offer a lease program for the iPhone in the future. However, there is no information about this at this time.

Here are some of the pros and cons of the iPhone Upgrade Program:

**Pros:**

* 0% APR financing
* Ability to upgrade to a new iPhone after 12 or 24 months
* Includes AppleCare+ coverage

**Cons:**

* You are still responsible for the full retail price of the iPhone if you cancel the program early
* You may have to pay a restocking fee if you return the iPhone in poor condition

If you are interested in leasing an iPhone, I recommend that you contact Apple or your local Apple Store to learn more about the iPhone Upgrade Program and the business financing program.
