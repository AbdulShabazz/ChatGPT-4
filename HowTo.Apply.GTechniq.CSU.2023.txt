Bard:

To apply Gtechniq Crystal Serum Ultra (CSU), you will need the following:

* Gtechniq CSU
* Gtechniq Panel Wipe
* Gtechniq Ultra Soft Microfiber Towel
* Gtechniq Level 2 Applicator
* Gtechniq Level 1 Applicator
* Nitrile gloves
* Tape
* Infrared (IR) thermometer
* Curing lamp (optional)

**Preparation:**

1. Wash and decontaminate the vehicle thoroughly.
2. Dry the vehicle completely.
3. Inspect the vehicle for any defects, such as scratches or swirls. If any defects are found, they should be corrected before applying CSU.
4. Tape off any areas that you do not want to be coated, such as trim or glass.

**Application:**

1. Apply a small amount of Gtechniq Panel Wipe to the Gtechniq Level 2 Applicator.
2. Wipe the applicator over the surface of the vehicle to remove any remaining residue.
3. Apply a single drop of CSU to the Gtechniq Level 1 Applicator.
4. Spread the CSU over a small area, approximately 2' x 2', using overlapping strokes.
5. Immediately buff the CSU using a clean Gtechniq Ultra Soft Microfiber Towel.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the entire vehicle has been coated.

**Curing:**

Once the entire vehicle has been coated, CSU must be cured for a minimum of 12 hours at a temperature of 65°F (18°C). For faster curing, you can use an IR thermometer to ensure that the surface temperature of the vehicle is between 120°F (49°C) and 140°F (60°C). You can also use a curing lamp to accelerate the curing process.

**Aftercare:**

Once CSU has cured, you can wash and maintain your vehicle as usual. However, it is important to avoid using any harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the coating.

**Additional tips:**

* Work in a well-ventilated area.
* Wear nitrile gloves to protect your hands.
* Apply CSU in thin, even coats.
* Do not buff CSU too hard, as this can damage the coating.
* If you make a mistake, immediately wipe it away with a clean Gtechniq Ultra Soft Microfiber Towel.

**Please note:** Gtechniq CSU is a professional-grade product and should only be applied by a trained and certified detailer.
