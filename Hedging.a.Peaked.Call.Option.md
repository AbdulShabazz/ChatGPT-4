**Q:** If I purchase a Call option which I sense has peaked off how should I hedge ?

**A:** If you believe that a call option you purchased has reached its peak value, there are a few ways you can hedge your position to protect your profits and limit potential losses:

1. Sell the call option: The most straightforward way to hedge is to close your position by selling the call option. This allows you to lock in your profits and eliminate further risk exposure.

2. Buy a put option: You can buy a put option with the same underlying asset and expiration date as your call option. This strategy, known as a "protective put," helps to limit your downside risk if the price of the underlying asset drops.

3. Sell a higher strike call option: If you want to maintain your bullish position but limit risk, you can sell a call option with a higher strike price on the same underlying asset and expiration date. This creates a spread called a "bull call spread," which caps your potential profit but also reduces your potential loss.

4. Sell the underlying asset: If you own the underlying asset, you can sell an equivalent number of shares to offset the potential loss from your call option. This strategy is called a "covered call."

5. Adjust your position size: You can reduce your overall exposure by selling a portion of your call options while still maintaining some upside potential.

The best hedging strategy depends on your risk tolerance, market outlook, and the costs associated with each approach (such as transaction fees and the bid-ask spread). It's essential to consider these factors and, if needed, consult with a financial professional before implementing any hedging strategy.

**Q:** Say I add a buy side PUT option leg to trading strategy, what is now the best way to exit the trading strategy ?

**A:** When you add a long put option to your existing long call option position, you create a strategy known as a "straddle." A straddle involves buying both a call and a put option with the same underlying asset, strike price, and expiration date. This strategy allows you to profit from significant price movements in either direction, as the gains from one option will offset the losses from the other.

To exit a straddle position, you have a few options:

1. Let the options expire: If both options are out-of-the-money (OTM) at expiration, you can choose to let them expire worthless. In this case, your loss would be limited to the total premium paid for both options.

2. Sell both options simultaneously: If either or both of your options are in-the-money (ITM) or have time value remaining, you can close your position by selling both the call and put options at the same time. This allows you to realize any profits or minimize losses.

3. Leg out of the position: You can exit one side of the straddle (either the call or the put) while holding the other, effectively transitioning into a single long option position. This approach might be suitable if you believe the underlying asset will move in a particular direction and you want to maintain exposure to that potential price movement.

4. Delta hedging: More advanced traders may choose to delta hedge their straddle position by buying or selling the underlying asset to maintain a delta-neutral position. This requires frequent adjustments and can be more complex to manage.

When deciding how to exit a straddle position, consider factors such as the underlying asset's price movement, time decay of the options, transaction costs, and your updated market outlook. Keep in mind that straddles can be risky and expensive due to the high premium paid for both options, so it's crucial to have a well-defined exit strategy in place.

**Q:** Is it a viable trading strategy to buy both a CALL option and a PUT option to open and then sell the option leg which does not produce, keeping in mind the option leg can always be re-added at a lower strike price if its a CALL or a higher strike price if its a PUT, if the sentiment changes ?

**A:** Yes, the strategy you described is known as a "strangle." A strangle involves buying both a call and a put option on the same underlying asset, with the same expiration date, but with different strike prices. Typically, the call option will have a higher strike price than the current market price, while the put option will have a lower strike price.

The main advantage of a strangle is that it allows you to profit from significant price movements in either direction without having to predict which direction the price will move. If the underlying asset's price rises substantially, the call option becomes profitable, while if the price drops significantly, the put option becomes profitable.

The strategy you mentioned, selling the non-performing leg and potentially re-entering at a more favorable strike price, is a form of active management that can help to optimize returns and limit losses. This approach is known as "rolling" the option position.

However, there are some considerations to keep in mind:

1. Strangles can be expensive due to the high premium paid for both out-of-the-money options. This means the underlying asset's price must move significantly for the strategy to be profitable.

2. Rolling options can incur additional transaction costs, which can eat into your potential profits.

3. Timing is crucial when rolling options, as you want to maximize the value of the sold option while minimizing the cost of the new option.

4. This strategy requires active management and a good understanding of options trading mechanics and market dynamics.

While this strategy can be viable, it's important to carefully consider your risk tolerance, market outlook, and the costs involved before implementing it. As with any options trading strategy, it's essential to have a well-defined plan for managing risk and exiting positions.

**Q:** Does rolling options produce more lucrative day trading results compared to other market timed trades ?

**A:** Rolling options can be a useful strategy for managing positions and potentially enhancing returns, but whether it produces more lucrative day trading results compared to other market-timed trades depends on various factors and market conditions.

Advantages of rolling options in day trading:

1. Flexibility: Rolling options allows you to adjust your position based on updated market sentiment and price movements, potentially optimizing your returns.

2. Risk management: By selling non-performing options and replacing them with ones that have a higher probability of profitability, you can better manage your risk exposure.

3. Leverage: Options provide leverage, allowing you to control a larger position with less capital, potentially amplifying your returns.

However, there are also challenges and risks associated with rolling options in day trading:

1. Time decay: Options are subject to time decay, meaning their value decreases as expiration approaches. This can work against you, especially if you are holding short-term options.

2. Higher transaction costs: Rolling options involves additional trades, which can increase your transaction costs and eat into your potential profits.

3. Market timing: Success with rolling options depends on your ability to accurately time your entries and exits, which can be challenging in fast-moving markets.

4. Complexity: Options trading and rolling strategies can be complex, requiring a good understanding of options pricing, greeks, and market dynamics.

Ultimately, the profitability of rolling options in day trading depends on your skill level, market knowledge, risk management, and the specific market conditions. Other market-timed trades, such as trading stocks, futures, or currencies, may be more suitable depending on your trading style, risk tolerance, and market outlook.

It's important to carefully consider your trading goals, risk tolerance, and market understanding before engaging in any day trading strategy. Additionally, it's crucial to practice proper risk management and have a well-defined trading plan in place.
