**Q:** Which film first included a scene with a smartphone ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** The first film to feature a scene with a device resembling a modern smartphone is likely the 1979 sci-fi movie "Star Trek: The Motion Picture." In the film, the character Pavel Chekov uses a device called a "communicator," which flips open and closely resembles a modern flip phone or smartphone. However, this was a fictional, futuristic device and not an actual working smartphone.

If you're asking about the first film to feature a real, working smartphone, that would be the 1987 film "Wall Street," directed by Oliver Stone. In the movie, the character Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas) is shown using a Motorola DynaTAC 8000X, one of the earliest commercially available mobile phones. While not a smartphone in the modern sense, it was one of the first instances of a mobile phone being used in a film.

The first movie to feature a more modern smartphone with a touchscreen interface and apps was the 2008 film "The Dark Knight." In the movie, the character Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) uses a Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, which was one of the first commercially available touchscreen smartphones.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Which film first featured a scene with an EV ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** The 1996 film "Gattaca" is often cited as one of the earliest major films to feature an electric vehicle (EV) prominently on screen. The movie, set in a dystopian future, includes several scenes with sleek, futuristic-looking EVs. The cars used in the film were actually modified electric concept cars built by General Motors, specifically the GM EV1.

However, there are a few earlier instances of EVs in films, though they may not have been as prominently featured:

1. "The Jetsons" (1962): While not a live-action film, this animated series featured futuristic electric cars powered by clean energy sources.

2. "The Blue Bird" (1976): This Soviet-American fantasy film featured a concept car called the "Aerocar," which was an electric vehicle designed by Ford.

3. "Revenge of the Electric Car" (2011): Although released later, this documentary film discusses the history of electric vehicles and includes footage of older EVs, including the GM EV1 from the 1990s.

It's worth noting that electric vehicles have existed since the late 19th century, so it's possible that some earlier films might have featured them in the background or in minor roles. However, "Gattaca" is often recognized as one of the first major films to give an EV a prominent role in a scene.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Which other film showcased technological firsts ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Several films throughout history have showcased technological firsts, either by featuring cutting-edge technology of their time or by predicting future innovations. Here are a few notable examples:

1. **"2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968) -** This film featured pioneering special effects, a realistic portrayal of space travel, and introduced the concept of artificial intelligence with the character HAL 9000.

2. **"Tron" (1982) -** One of the earliest films to extensively use computer-generated imagery (CGI), "Tron" paved the way for the use of digital animation and special effects in movies.

3. **"WarGames" (1983) -** This movie introduced the concept of hacking and the potential dangers of computer-controlled military systems to a mainstream audience.

4. **"Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (1991) -** The film showcased groundbreaking CGI with its shape-shifting T-1000 character, setting a new standard for digital effects in movies.

5. **"Jurassic Park" (1993) -** The movie's use of CGI dinosaurs, combined with animatronics, marked a significant advancement in visual effects and showed the potential for bringing extinct creatures to life on screen.

6. **"The Matrix" (1999) -** The film's pioneering "bullet time" visual effect, which created the illusion of slow motion while the camera appeared to move at normal speed, was a stunning innovation in special effects.

7. **"Minority Report" (2002) -** This film featured several futuristic technologies that have since become a reality or are in development, such as gesture-based interfaces, personalized advertising, and predictive policing.

These are just a few examples, as there have been numerous other films that have pushed the boundaries of filmmaking technology and showcased innovations on the big screen.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
