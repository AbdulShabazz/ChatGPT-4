The ASCII character set is inherently limited in its ability to represent specialized phonetic symbols like those found in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). However, the UTF-8 character encoding can accommodate a much broader range of characters, including those utilized in the IPA. It is important to note that while UTF-8 is capable of encoding any character in the Unicode standard, ASCII is a subset of UTF-8 and is limited to 128 characters.

Here is a mapping of IPA symbols to ASCII characters where possible, along with their corresponding UTF-8 hexadecimal representation for the symbols that don't have an ASCII counterpart. Note that the representations are approximations and won't convey the phonetic nuance that the IPA symbols do.

### American English
- "Hello": /həˈloʊ/
  - /h/ : 'h' (ASCII: 0x68)
  - /ə/ : 'ə' (UTF-8 Hex: 0xC9 0x99)
  - /ˈl/ : 'l' (ASCII: 0x6C)
  - /oʊ/ : 'o' (ASCII: 0x6F) + 'ʊ' (UTF-8 Hex: 0xCA 0x8A)
- "World": /wɝld/
  - /w/ : 'w' (ASCII: 0x77)
  - /ɝ/ : 'ɝ' (UTF-8 Hex: 0xC9 0x9D)
  - /l/ : 'l' (ASCII: 0x6C)
  - /d/ : 'd' (ASCII: 0x64)

### British English
- "Hello": /hɛˈləʊ/
  - /h/ : 'h' (ASCII: 0x68)
  - /ɛ/ : 'ɛ' (UTF-8 Hex: 0xC9 0x9B)
  - /ˈl/ : 'l' (ASCII: 0x6C)
  - /əʊ/ : 'ə' (UTF-8 Hex: 0xC9 0x99) + 'ʊ' (UTF-8 Hex: 0xCA 0x8A)
- "World": /wɜːld/
  - /w/ : 'w' (ASCII: 0x77)
  - /ɜː/ : 'ɜ' (UTF-8 Hex: 0xC9 0x9C)
  - /l/ : 'l' (ASCII: 0x6C)
  - /d/ : 'd' (ASCII: 0x64)

Note that the ASCII representations are, at best, approximations and are not capable of representing the precise phonetic details that the IPA symbols communicate. However, the UTF-8 hex values provide a more accurate representation of the IPA characters. Utilizing a Unicode-enabled text environment will allow for the correct display of these UTF-8 encoded characters.
