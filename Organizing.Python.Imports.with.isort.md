**Q:** what is isort (python) ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** isort is a Python utility and library that is used to sort imports alphabetically and automatically separate them into sections and by type. It provides a simple command-line interface as well as a Python API to sort imports in Python source files.

Key features of isort include:

1. Sorting imports alphabetically within each section.
2. Separating imports into sections based on their type (e.g., standard library, third-party packages, local modules).
3. Automatically removing unused imports.
4. Supporting various Python coding styles and PEP 8 guidelines.
5. Handling multi-line imports and comments.
6. Integrating with popular Python IDEs and editors.

Here's an example of how isort can be used from the command line:

```
$ isort mypythonfile.py
```

This command will sort the imports in the `mypythonfile.py` file according to the default isort configuration.

isort can also be integrated into Python projects as a pre-commit hook or as part of a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to enforce consistent import ordering and style across the codebase.

By using isort, developers can maintain a clean and organized structure for their Python imports, making the code more readable and maintainable. It helps avoid common issues like importing unused modules, inconsistent ordering of imports, and violating coding style guidelines related to imports.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
