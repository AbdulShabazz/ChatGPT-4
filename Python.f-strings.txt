The other form of Python print statements is the `f-strings` syntax. F-strings are a more modern and concise way to format strings than traditional Python string formatting.

To use f-strings, you simply enclose the string in curly braces (`{}`) and then place the expressions you want to evaluate inside the curly braces. The expressions will be evaluated and the results will be substituted into the string.

For example, the following code shows how to use f-strings to format a string:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 19

formatted_string = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

print(formatted_string)
```

Output:

```
Hello, Alice! You are 19 years old.
```

F-strings can also be used to format strings with more complex logic. For example, you can use f-strings to generate strings that contain conditional statements or loops.

Here is an example of an f-string that uses a conditional statement:

```python
age = 19

formatted_string = f"If you are over 18, you can vote. Otherwise, you cannot vote."

if age >= 18:
  formatted_string += " You can vote."
else:
  formatted_string += " You cannot vote."

print(formatted_string)
```

Output:

```
If you are over 18, you can vote. You can vote.
```

F-strings are a powerful tool for formatting strings in a concise and readable way. They are a good alternative to traditional Python string formatting for most cases.

Here are some additional tips for using f-strings:

* You can use the `:{format_spec}` syntax to specify a format specifier for the expression. For example, the f-string `"{age:.2f}"` will format the `age` expression as a floating-point number with two decimal places.
* You can use the `{name!r}` syntax to format the expression `name` as a raw string. This is useful for formatting strings that contain special characters, such as newline characters or quotation marks.
* There are a number of third-party libraries that provide additional features for using f-strings. For example, the `f-string-formatter` library provides support for formatting dates and times.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
