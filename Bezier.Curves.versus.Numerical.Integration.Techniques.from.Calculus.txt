Bezier algorithms, commonly used in computer graphics and related fields, do not perform numerical integration in the traditional mathematical sense. Instead, Bezier curves provide a way of defining a smooth curve controlled by a set of points, known as control points. The key characteristics and processes involved in Bezier curve algorithms can be described as follows:

1. **Definition of Bezier Curves**:
   - A Bezier curve is defined by a set of control points.
   - The most common types are linear, quadratic, cubic, and higher-order Bezier curves, differentiated by the number of control points they use.
   - The curve is a parametric curve that does not explicitly provide a function in the form of \( y = f(x) \) but rather defines points in a coordinate system as functions of a parameter, typically denoted as \( t \) (where \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \)).

2. **How Bezier Curves are Computed**:
   - The algorithm uses a mathematical technique known as the Bernstein polynomial to interpolate the curve.
   - The position of a point on the curve is calculated as a weighted sum of the control points, where the weights are determined by the Bernstein polynomials that depend on the parameter \( t \).

3. **De Casteljau's Algorithm**:
   - A common algorithm for evaluating Bezier curves is De Casteljau's algorithm.
   - It is a recursive algorithm that linearly interpolates between control points, subdividing the control points iteratively until it reaches the desired point on the curve.

4. **Difference from Numerical Integration**:
   - Numerical integration involves computing the integral of a function or approximating the area under a curve.
   - In contrast, Bezier curve algorithms are more about curve construction and interpolation between control points.
   - While both processes involve calculations with respect to a curve, the objectives and mathematical operations are fundamentally different.

5. **Applications of Bezier Curves**:
   - Bezier curves are widely used in vector graphics, computer-aided design (CAD), animation, and other areas where smooth curve representation is needed.
   - They offer precision and ease of control over the shape of the curve, making them ideal for these applications.

In summary, while Bezier algorithms and numerical integration both deal with curves, they serve different purposes. Bezier algorithms are about constructing and manipulating curves using control points, whereas numerical integration is about calculating the integral of a function or area under a curve.
