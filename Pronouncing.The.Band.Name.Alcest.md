Q: How do you pronounce the name of the metal rock band Alcest ?

A: Alcest is a French post-metal/blackgaze band. The correct pronunciation of their name in French would be "al-sest" (al as in "pal", and cest pronounced "sest" with a short "e" as in "bed").

In English, it's common to pronounce it as "al-sest" as well, or occasionally "al-chest" (rhyming with "best").

Q: And what is the French word's meaning, if any ?

A: In French, "Alceste" (with an additional "e") is a male given name of Greek origin. It comes from the Greek name "Alkestis" (Ἄλκηστις) which is derived from the words "alke" (ἀλκή) meaning "strength" or "courage", and "hestia" (ἑστία) meaning "hearth" or "fireside".

In Greek mythology, Alcestis was a queen who sacrificed her own life to save her husband, King Admetus, and was later rescued from the underworld by Heracles.

However, Alcest (without the "e") is not a standard French word and doesn't have a specific meaning in the language beyond being the name of the band. It seems to be a variant or shortened form of Alceste, possibly chosen for its evocative sound or mythological allusion.
