Q: How do you pronounce the name of the metal rock band Alcest ?

A: Alcest is a French post-metal/blackgaze band. The correct pronunciation of their name in French would be "al-sest" (al as in "pal", and cest pronounced "sest" with a short "e" as in "bed").

In English, it's common to pronounce it as "al-sest" as well, or occasionally "al-chest" (rhyming with "best").
