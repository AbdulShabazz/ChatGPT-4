Thank you! Thank you! My background in power line design motivates me to use these size 0# half-inch thick cables everywhere, as the final statement in quality. And as the ultimate keepsake for you doing business with me I intend to ship the most desired item in the macguffin, which is as of yet still unseen by the world's most enthusiastic audiophiles. 

Q: is the lower frequency always considered the modulator 

A: Not necessarily. The carrier and modulator frequencies can be chosen independently in FM synthesis. However, the ratio between them affects the harmonic structure of the resulting sound. A simple ratio, such as 1:1 or 2:1, will produce a harmonic sound, while a complex ratio, such as 3:2 or 5:4, will produce an inharmonic sound. The carrier frequency determines the perceived pitch of the sound, while the modulator frequency determines the timbre or tone color of the sound. 

If you use a sawtooth wave as the carrier and a sinusoid as the modulator, you will get a different metallic sound than the previous example. The sawtooth wave has more harmonics than the sinusoid, so the resulting sound will be richer and brighter. The modulation index will still control the amount of inharmonicity in the sound, but the harmonic spectrum will be more complex. 

Yes, harmonics can be analogized to musical chords in some ways. A chord is a combination of notes that sound pleasing or harmonious together. A harmonic is a note that is a multiple of the fundamental frequency of a sound. When you play a note on a musical instrument, you are actually producing a sound that contains many harmonics. The relative strength and number of these harmonics determine the timbre or quality of the sound. Different instruments have different harmonic spectra, which is why they sound different even when playing the same note.

A chord can be seen as a superposition of different harmonics from different notes. For example, a major chord consists of three notes: the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth. The root note has the lowest frequency, and the other two notes have frequencies that are 4/3 and 3/2 times the root frequency, respectively. These ratios are simple fractions, which means that the harmonics of these notes will align well with each other, creating a consonant or pleasant sound. A dissonant or unpleasant sound occurs when the harmonics of different notes clash or interfere with each other, creating a complex ratio.

However, the analogy between harmonics and chords is not perfect, because chords are usually played in a specific musical context, such as a scale, a key, or a genre. Harmonics are more general and abstract, and do not depend on any musical conventions. Also, chords can have more than three notes, and can include notes that are not harmonics of the root note, such as the seventh or the ninth. These notes add more color and tension to the chord, and can create different moods and emotions in the listener. Harmonics are more neutral and objective, and do not have any inherent meaning or expression. 

Aperiodic sounds are sounds that do not have a regular or repeating pattern in their waveform. They are often associated with noise, such as white noise, pink noise, or brown noise. Aperiodic sounds can also be produced by transient events, such as clicks, pops, or bursts. Aperiodic sounds do not have a well-defined pitch or frequency, but they can have a spectrum that shows the distribution of energy across different frequency bands. Aperiodic sounds can be used to create effects such as hiss, rumble, or crackle in sound synthesis. ¹²

Half-sinusoids are sinusoidal waves that have been clipped or rectified, so that only the positive or negative half of the cycle remains. Half-sinusoids are not periodic, because they do not repeat exactly after one cycle. However, they can be approximated by a series of harmonics that have odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, a half-sinusoid with a fundamental frequency of 100 Hz can be approximated by adding together sinusoids with frequencies of 100 Hz, 300 Hz, 500 Hz, and so on. Half-sinusoids have a sharper and more distorted sound than full sinusoids, and they can be used to create effects such as buzz, fuzz, or distortion in sound synthesis. 

Q: The effect of Phase on Sinusoidals

No, phase also affects the frequency of the resulting sound. In FM synthesis, the phase of the carrier wave is changed by the modulator wave, which means that the frequency of the carrier wave is also changed. The frequency deviation depends on both the amplitude and the phase of the modulator wave. If the modulator wave has a constant amplitude, then the frequency deviation is proportional to the phase difference between the carrier and the modulator. If the modulator wave has a varying amplitude, then the frequency deviation is also affected by the amplitude envelope of the modulator. ¹²

You can think of phase as the position of the wave along its cycle, and frequency as the speed of the wave along its cycle. When the phase of the wave changes, the position of the wave shifts, which means that the wave has to catch up or slow down to complete its cycle. This causes the frequency of the wave to change as well. The amount of frequency change depends on how much the phase changes and how fast it changes.
