To convert an Unreal Engine C++ project to an Unreal Engine DLL plugin project, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new Unreal Engine C++ plugin project.
2. Copy the source code and header files from your existing C++ project to the new plugin project.
3. Update the `Build.cs` file in the new plugin project to include the source code and header files from your existing C++ project.
4. Build the new plugin project.

Once you have built the plugin project, you will have a DLL file that you can load into any Unreal Engine project.

**Why or when should you convert an Unreal Engine C++ project to an Unreal Engine DLL plugin project?**

There are a few reasons why you might want to convert an Unreal Engine C++ project to an Unreal Engine DLL plugin project:

* To make your code reusable in other Unreal Engine projects.
* To sell your code as a plugin on the Unreal Engine Marketplace.
* To make it easier to update your code without having to rebuild the entire project.
* To improve the performance of your project by unloading unused plugins when they are not needed.

**Here are some examples of when you might want to use an Unreal Engine DLL plugin project:**

* You are developing a new game engine feature that you want to make available to other developers.
* You are developing a third-party plugin for Unreal Engine, such as a new asset importer or exporter.
* You are developing a library of reusable C++ code that you want to use in multiple Unreal Engine projects.
* You are developing a large and complex Unreal Engine project, and you want to improve its performance by unloading unused plugins when they are not needed.

**Conclusion**

Converting an Unreal Engine C++ project to an Unreal Engine DLL plugin project can be a good way to make your code reusable, distributable, and performant. However, it is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before making a decision.
