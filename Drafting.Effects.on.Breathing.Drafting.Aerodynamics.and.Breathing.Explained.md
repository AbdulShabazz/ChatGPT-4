**Q:** When you're in the draft of a vehicle, the air should be separated so theoretically it should be difficult to breathe within that region, correct ?

**A:** When drafting a vehicle, you are typically positioned close behind another vehicle to reduce air resistance. This tactic, common in cycling, motorsports, and even long-distance running, exploits the aerodynamic effect where the leading vehicle pushes air aside, creating a low-pressure wake zone behind it.

### Aerodynamics of Drafting

- **Airflow Dynamics**:
  - The lead vehicle moves through the air, displacing it and creating a turbulent wake with lower air pressure.
  - The trailing vehicle encounters less air resistance because it is partially shielded from the oncoming air, allowing it to maintain speed with less effort.

- **Pressure Changes**:
  - The low-pressure wake behind the lead vehicle creates a pocket where the trailing vehicle experiences less drag.
  - This pocket of reduced pressure can extend a significant distance behind the lead vehicle, depending on speed, vehicle shape, and atmospheric conditions.

### Breathing Considerations

- **Air Quality**:
  - While the pressure in the wake zone is lower, the composition of the air remains unchanged. There is no significant reduction in the oxygen content or quality of the air.
  - If drafting behind an internal combustion engine vehicle, exhaust fumes might be a concern, but this is unrelated to the aerodynamic effects.

- **Breathability**:
  - There is no inherent difficulty in breathing within the draft zone purely due to the aerodynamic low pressure. Human lungs are capable of adapting to slight variations in external pressure without noticeable impact on breathability.
  - Any perceived difficulty in breathing is more likely due to physical exertion or environmental factors rather than aerodynamic effects.

### Conclusion

- **Aerodynamic Drafting**:
  - The primary benefit is reduced air resistance for the trailing vehicle.
  - The low-pressure zone does not significantly impact the breathability for someone within it.
  - Any perceived difficulty in breathing would be more related to physical or environmental factors, not the aerodynamic properties of the draft itself. 

In summary, drafting provides aerodynamic advantages without creating a difficult breathing environment. The reduced air resistance in the wake zone doesn't alter the air composition, so breathing remains unaffected under typical conditions.

**Q:** So the only thing that has changed is the air pressure not the air volume or density of air ?

**A:** Yes, that is correct. When drafting behind a vehicle, the primary change is in the air pressure within the wake zone. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Changes in Aerodynamics When Drafting

- **Air Pressure**:
  - The air pressure in the wake zone behind the leading vehicle is reduced due to the displacement of air and the creation of a turbulent wake.
  - This low-pressure area reduces aerodynamic drag for the trailing vehicle, allowing it to move more efficiently.

- **Air Volume and Density**:
  - The volume of air in the wake zone remains the same as in the surrounding environment. Air is a compressible fluid, but the changes in volume due to drafting are negligible at typical vehicle speeds.
  - The density of the air also remains effectively unchanged. Air density is primarily a function of altitude, temperature, and atmospheric conditions, not the localized aerodynamic effects created by drafting.

### Practical Implications

- **Breathing**:
  - Human respiration is not significantly affected by the slight reduction in pressure in the wake zone. The change in pressure is relatively small compared to the body's ability to regulate breathing and oxygen intake.
  - The volume and density of air being inhaled remain constant, ensuring that the oxygen supply to the body is not compromised.

### Summary

- **Air Pressure**: Reduced in the wake zone, leading to lower aerodynamic drag.
- **Air Volume**: Unchanged, as the displacement of air does not affect its overall volume.
- **Air Density**: Unchanged, as the density is influenced by broader atmospheric conditions rather than localized aerodynamic effects.

Therefore, while drafting primarily alters the air pressure behind a vehicle, it does not significantly change the air volume or density, ensuring that breathing remains unaffected.
