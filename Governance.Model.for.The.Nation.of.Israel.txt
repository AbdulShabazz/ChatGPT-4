Bard:

Israel's governance is structured as a parliamentary democracy, meaning that the executive branch is subordinate to the legislative branch. The President of Israel is the head of state, while the Prime Minister of Israel is the head of government.

**The President**

The President of Israel is a largely ceremonial position with limited powers. The President is elected by a majority vote of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, for a seven-year term. The President's duties include:

* Appointing the Prime Minister, based on the results of Knesset elections
* Signing laws passed by the Knesset
* Representing Israel to foreign countries

The President also has the power to pardon criminals and grant clemency, but these powers are rarely used.

**The Prime Minister**

The Prime Minister of Israel is the head of government and the leader of the largest party or coalition of parties in the Knesset. The Prime Minister is responsible for:

* Forming the government, which is a cabinet of ministers
* Determining government policy
* Representing Israel to foreign countries

The Prime Minister is also the commander-in-chief of the Israeli Defense Forces.

**Relationship between the President and Prime Minister**

In practice, the Prime Minister is the most powerful figure in Israeli politics. The President has little power to influence the government, and the Prime Minister can override the President's veto of a law with a two-thirds majority vote of the Knesset.

However, the President can still play an important role in Israeli politics. The President can use their moral authority to influence public opinion and the government. The President can also serve as a mediator between different factions in Israeli society.

Here is a table summarizing the key differences between the roles of the President and Prime Minister in Israel:

| Role | President | Prime Minister |
|---|---|---|
| Head of state | Yes | No |
| Head of government | No | Yes |
| Elected by | Knesset | Knesset |
| Term of office | 7 years | No fixed term |
| Key powers | Appointing the Prime Minister, signing laws, representing Israel to foreign countries | Forming the government, determining government policy, representing Israel to foreign countries |

The division of power between the President and Prime Minister in Israel is similar to that of the United States, but there are some key differences.

The President's powers include:
