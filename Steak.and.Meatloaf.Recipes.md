**A:** Certainly! Here’s a recipe for a savory steak and meatloaf combination that brings out the best of both dishes:

### Savory Steak and Meatloaf Recipe

#### Ingredients

**For the Steak:**
- 2 ribeye or sirloin steaks (about 1 inch thick)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

**For the Meatloaf:**
- 1 lb ground beef (80/20 blend for best flavor)
- ½ lb ground pork
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/4 cup whole milk
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon ketchup (plus more for topping)
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### Instructions

**For the Steak:**

1. **Prepare the Steaks:**
   - Pat the steaks dry with a paper towel to ensure a good sear.
   - Season both sides generously with salt, pepper, minced garlic, chopped rosemary, and thyme.
   - Let the steaks rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking.

2. **Cook the Steaks:**
   - Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and let it heat until it begins to shimmer.
   - Place the steaks in the skillet and sear for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until a deep brown crust forms.
   - In the last minute of cooking, add the butter and spoon it over the steaks to baste them.
   - Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest for at least 5 minutes before serving.

**For the Meatloaf:**

1. **Prepare the Meatloaf Mixture:**
   - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, ground pork, chopped onion, minced garlic, breadcrumbs, milk, beaten egg, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, ketchup, smoked paprika, thyme, oregano, salt, and pepper.
   - Mix everything until just combined. Avoid overmixing to keep the meatloaf tender.

2. **Shape and Bake:**
   - Transfer the meatloaf mixture to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Shape it into a loaf, about 9 inches long and 4 inches wide.
   - Brush the top of the meatloaf with additional ketchup for a glaze.
   - Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C).
   - Let the meatloaf rest for 10 minutes before slicing.

**Serving Suggestions:**
- Serve the steak and meatloaf with mashed potatoes or roasted vegetables for a hearty meal.
- A rich gravy or a side of steak sauce can enhance the flavors of both the steak and the meatloaf.

### Tips:
- **Steak:** For added flavor, you can marinate the steaks in the garlic and herb mixture for a few hours before cooking.
- **Meatloaf:** Feel free to add grated cheese or chopped vegetables (like bell peppers or mushrooms) to the meatloaf mixture for extra flavor and texture.

This recipe gives you the best of both worlds—succulent steaks and a comforting meatloaf, perfect for a satisfying meal.
