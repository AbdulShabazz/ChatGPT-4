User:

in what film does the iconic quote come from: 'we'll do it live!'?

ChatGPT:

The quote "We'll do it live!" is not from a film. It's actually a famous outburst from Bill O'Reilly during his time as a host on the show "Inside Edition." A behind-the-scenes video leaked showing O'Reilly getting frustrated with the teleprompter and eventually exclaiming the now-famous line. The clip became viral, and the quote has since been widely referenced and parodied in various forms of media.
