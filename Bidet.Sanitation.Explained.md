**Q:** Is a bidet sanitary? It doesn't seem sanitary to have a water nozzle spraying upwards against gravity to douse nether body parts !​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Bidets are generally considered sanitary when properly used and maintained. Here's a brief explanation:

1. Water spray: The water spray is typically clean, fresh water - the same as from your tap or shower.

2. Nozzle design: Most modern bidets have self-cleaning nozzles and are designed to prevent backflow contamination.

3. Gravity: While the water does spray upwards, it's under pressure and doesn't simply fall back onto the nozzle.

4. Cleanliness: Bidets can actually be more hygienic than toilet paper alone, as they wash away bacteria more effectively.

5. Maintenance: Regular cleaning of the bidet, like any bathroom fixture, helps ensure its sanitation.

That said, proper use and hygiene practices are important. If you have specific concerns, I can elaborate on bidet hygiene and maintenance.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
