**Q:** If before a November election the president elect flees the country to avoid criminal sentencing in a state offense trial, is there a scenario in which he or she can be issued clemency et al or have their sentence commuted subsequent before attempting to return and take political office ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** This is a complex hypothetical scenario involving multiple legal and constitutional issues. Let me break it down:

Firstly, if a president-elect flees the country to avoid criminal sentencing in a state trial, that would likely be considered an admission of guilt and would probably result in the trial proceeding without them and a sentence being handed down in absentia.

Secondly, the president's pardon power only applies to federal crimes, not state crimes. So the president could not pardon themselves or be pardoned by their successor for state offenses.

However, depending on the state, the governor may have the power to grant clemency, commute the sentence, or offer a pardon for state crimes. This varies by state constitution. But in this scenario, it seems unlikely a governor would take such an action, as it would be highly controversial to let a president-elect avoid accountability for state crimes serious enough to warrant a prison sentence.

Additionally, fleeing the country to avoid criminal sentencing could potentially open the president-elect up to federal charges like contempt of court or obstruction of justice. While these could theoretically be pardoned federally, it would be a major constitutional crisis.

Ultimately, if a president-elect has been convicted of serious state crimes and fled the country, it is exceedingly unlikely they would be able to avoid accountability through clemency or sentence commutation by returning later to assume the presidency. The political and legal hurdles would be immense. It would be an unprecedented situation testing the limits of state vs. federal power and rule of law at the highest levels.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
