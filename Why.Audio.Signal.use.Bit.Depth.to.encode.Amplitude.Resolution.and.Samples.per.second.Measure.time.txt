That is an interesting question. The answer has to do with how audio signals are digitized and represented in a computer.

The horizontal axis of an audio curve represents time, and the vertical axis represents amplitude. To digitize an audio signal, we need to measure both the time and the amplitude of the signal at discrete points. This process is called sampling and quantization.

Sampling is the process of measuring the value of a continuous signal at fixed time intervals. The sampling rate is the number of samples taken in one second and is measured in hertz (Hz). The sampling rate determines the highest frequency that can be captured from the signal, according to the Nyquist theorem¹.

Quantization is the process of measuring the amplitude of the signal at each sample point and assigning it to a discrete value. The bit depth is the number of bits used to represent each amplitude value. The bit depth determines the dynamic range and the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal².

The reason why the horizontal and vertical axes use different units is because they measure different aspects of the signal. The horizontal axis measures the temporal resolution, which depends on the sampling rate. The vertical axis measures the amplitude resolution, which depends on the bit depth. These two parameters are independent of each other and can be adjusted according to the desired quality and size of the audio file.

To illustrate this, imagine you have a digital camera that can take pictures of different resolutions and sizes. The horizontal and vertical dimensions of the picture are measured in pixels, which determine the spatial resolution. The color depth of each pixel is measured in bits, which determine the color resolution. You can change the resolution and the size of the picture by changing the number of pixels or the number of bits per pixel, or both. Similarly, you can change the resolution and the size of the audio file by changing the sampling rate or the bit depth, or both.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the concept of audio curve axis quantization. If you want to learn more, you can check out these links:
