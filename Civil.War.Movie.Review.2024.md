Oscar Nomination for Best Screenplay, without a doubt!

People may confuse the requirement of a good story with one that is impactful, and this screenplay has a ton of impact. There are scenes in the film that are chilling, and saddening, but one thing the screenplay is not is false. Every scene in the film although this may spark intense debate is really accurate and true to life to how most people would react in these situations, after factoring in their past life experiences. Most issues people will have with the film are attributed to the director, Alex Garland, and his poor taste or lack of it. Otherwise, the sound design, cinematography, and screenplay are spot-on!

Hopefully, the Academy Awards Committee will read this post, and go see the film.
