As I was feeding a gaggle of maybe ten baby geese and two adult geese a loaf of bread consisting of maybe 24 slices. I was surprised when the baby geese kept eating even I neared the bottom of the loaf. Do geese not have a quiescent point, or are there adult cues so I know when to stop feeding them?!

ChatGPT:

Feeding bread to geese is a common activity many people enjoy. However, there are a few things to consider:

    Dietary Considerations: Bread isn't the best food for geese. It's like junk food for them. While they might eagerly eat it because it's easily consumable and tasty, bread doesn't offer the necessary nutrients for a healthy goose diet. Consuming too much bread can also lead to malnutrition and other health issues for the geese.

    Quiescent Point: Like many animals, geese will often continue eating if food is available, especially if it's something they find tasty. Their natural diet requires them to forage for extended periods, so they might not instinctively stop eating when full if presented with an easy food source like bread.

    Overfeeding: Overfeeding can lead to health issues for geese, such as "angel wing," a condition where the wing joints of waterfowl develop incorrectly due to a high-calorie diet, leading to deformities.

    Environmental Impact: Uneaten bread can pollute waterways and attract pests. It can also cause algal blooms in ponds and lakes, which can be harmful to fish and other aquatic life.

    Alternative Foods: If you want to feed geese, consider giving them foods that are closer to their natural diet, such as cut-up leafy greens (like lettuce or kale), seeds, or even special waterfowl pellets.

    Adult Cues: Adult geese usually monitor their young closely and might become more aggressive or protective if they feel there's any threat. While they may not specifically signal to you that their goslings have had enough to eat, it's essential to be aware of the adult geese's body language. If they seem agitated or protective, it's a good idea to back away.

In conclusion, while feeding geese can be a delightful experience, it's essential to be aware of their dietary needs and the potential consequences of overfeeding them. If you're unsure, it's always best to err on the side of caution and avoid feeding wild animals altogether.

What grocery brands of seed are recommended?

ChatGPT:

When you're looking for seeds to feed to geese or any other birds, it's best to opt for seeds formulated specifically for them rather than grabbing something off the grocery store shelf.

For bird feeding, brands often specialize in producing bird food and offer a range of seed mixes tailored to different bird species. Here are some popular brands known for quality bird seeds as of my last update in September 2021:

    Kaytee: Offers a wide range of bird foods, including those for wild birds and specific pet bird species.

    Wagner's: Known for their wild bird seed mixes and they have options for different bird species and regions.

    Audubon Park: They produce various seed mixes to attract different species of wild birds.

    Lyric: Specializes in premium wild bird food mixes.

    Pennington: Offers both wild bird seed and products for lawn and garden.

    Harrison's Bird Foods: While more for pet birds, they are known for their organic formulations.

Remember to choose the mix or type of seed appropriate for the birds you're feeding. For instance, waterfowl like geese might prefer grains like corn, whereas smaller songbirds might go for sunflower seeds, millet, or nyjer.

Lastly, always check the freshness of seeds. Rancid or moldy seeds can harm birds. And if you're looking to feed geese specifically, remember that whole kernel corn, leafy greens, and waterfowl pellets are healthier options than bread. Always consult local guidelines or experts if you're unsure about feeding wild animals in your area.

What type of grocery whole kernel corn is recommended?

ChatGPT:

If you're looking to buy whole kernel corn from a grocery store to feed geese or other wildlife, consider the following:

    Organic: Organic corn is free from pesticides, herbicides, and genetically modified organisms (GMOs). It might be a healthier choice for feeding wildlife.

    Frozen Whole Kernel Corn: This is a common product in many grocery store freezers. Just make sure to thaw it before feeding.

    Canned Whole Kernel Corn: If you're using canned corn, opt for those without added salt or preservatives. Make sure to drain the liquid and rinse the corn before feeding.

    Dried Whole Kernel Corn: Often found in feed stores more than grocery stores. It's a more natural form of corn to feed to birds, but you may want to soak it to soften it up a bit.

    Brand: Brand preferences can vary by region and availability. Some well-known brands that offer whole kernel corn in grocery stores include Green Giant, Del Monte, and Birds Eye for frozen varieties. For organic options, you might look for brands like Amy's or Whole Foods' 365 Everyday Value.

    Non-GMO: If you have concerns about genetically modified organisms, look for corn labeled as Non-GMO.

Always remember that corn, while a part of the natural diet for many birds, should be given in moderation and as part of a balanced diet. It's always good to consult with local wildlife experts or organizations if you're unsure about the best practices for feeding wildlife in your area.
