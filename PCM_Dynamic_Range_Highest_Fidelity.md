To further enhance the audio quality and extract the highest fidelity from your signals, you can consider several signal processing techniques. Here are a few approaches:

1. **Normalization**: Adjust the overall gain of the audio file to maximize the amplitude without exceeding the dynamic range. This process ensures that the audio uses the full range available, improving the signal-to-noise ratio.

2. **Dynamic Range Compression**: This reduces the difference between the loudest and softest parts of your audio. Compressors reduce the gain of audio signals that exceed a certain threshold, thereby "compressing" the dynamic range. This allows quieter parts to be amplified without clipping louder parts, maintaining more consistent levels.

3. **Dithering**: When reducing bit depth (quantizing) or during other digital signal processing steps, dithering can be applied. It's a form of noise added to the signal before quantization to mask quantization noise at low levels, which can enhance perceived audio quality.

4. **Equalization (EQ)**: Adjusting the balance between frequency components within an audio signal can greatly affect perception of clarity and depth. Using EQ to subtly boost or cut certain frequencies can help to bring out the best in your recording.

5. **Upsampling and Oversampling**: Before processing signals, upsampling can be beneficial. This increases the sample rate by inserting additional samples into the signal, which can help in the processing stages by reducing aliasing and allowing for more precise manipulations of the audio signal.

6. **Advanced Limiting**: While similar to compression, limiting strictly prevents audio from exceeding a set threshold, but it does so very abruptly compared to compressors. This can be useful for ensuring that your audio does not exceed the dynamic range in any instance, particularly useful in mastering audio tracks.

7. **Look-ahead Processing**: Some dynamic range compressors and limiters use look-ahead buffers to anticipate peaks before they happen. This allows more transparent control of dynamics since the processor can react before the peak occurs.

Each of these techniques can be used judiciously to enhance the fidelity of the audio, depending on the specific requirements of the material and the desired outcome. The key is to use these tools to manage the dynamic range effectively while preserving the natural characteristics and intended expression of the original audio.
