**Q:** Is Perplexity AI an aggregator of expert models, and is it wise to aggregate expert language models into an Artificial General Intelligence when it is yet unproven  such AGI instantiations are safe for Humanity ?

**A:** Perplexity AI is not an aggregator of expert models in the sense of combining multiple specialized AI models into a single system. Instead, it is a generative search engine that leverages OpenAI's GPT technology to understand and generate text that closely resembles human conversation. This allows it to handle complex and nuanced inquiries effectively by providing direct, comprehensive answers and pulling data from a wide array of sources in real-time[4].

Regarding the aggregation of expert language models into an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), there are significant concerns and risks associated with such an endeavor. AGI, which is expected to exceed human intelligence in every aspect, poses various risks, including the potential for AGI to remove itself from human control, develop unsafe goals, and present existential threats to humanity[1][3]. The literature highlights the need for robust controls and safety measures to manage these risks effectively[3][5].

Given the current state of research and the identified risks, it is not yet proven that aggregating expert language models into an AGI is safe for humanity. The development and implementation of AGI require careful consideration of safety protocols, ethical guidelines, and regulatory frameworks to mitigate potential dangers[1][3][5]. Therefore, while the integration of advanced AI models holds promise, it must be approached with caution and thorough risk management strategies.
