To upgrade Verizon Home Internet Plus to FIOS, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the Verizon website or call Verizon customer service at 1-800-VERIZON.
2. Let the representative know that you would like to upgrade to FIOS.
3. The representative will check to see if FIOS is available in your area. If it is, they will help you choose a plan and schedule an installation appointment.
4. On the day of the installation, a Verizon technician will come to your home and install the necessary equipment.
5. Once the installation is complete, you will be able to start using your new FIOS internet service.

**Note:** If you have any existing Verizon services, such as TV or phone, you can also bundle them with your FIOS internet service to save money.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when upgrading to FIOS:

* There may be a setup fee associated with upgrading to FIOS.
* Verizon may require you to sign a contract when you upgrade to FIOS. Be sure to read the terms of the contract carefully before signing it.
* If you are not satisfied with your FIOS service, you may be able to cancel your contract early. However, there may be an early termination fee associated with canceling your contract early.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
