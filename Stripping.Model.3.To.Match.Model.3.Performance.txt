How much weight must be removed from a Tesla Model 3 Long Range to achieve the same 0-60 mph 3.1 second acceleration as a Model 3 Performance?

ChatGPT:

The acceleration of a car is influenced by various factors, including its weight, power, torque, aerodynamics, tires, and more. Therefore, simply reducing weight isn't the only way to achieve a particular acceleration time, and the relationship isn't perfectly linear. However, I can provide a rough estimate based on the power-to-weight ratio, although it's a simplification.

    Find the power-to-weight ratios of both cars.

Let's use rough numbers:

Model 3 Performance:
Power = P1 (in HP)
Weight = W1 (in lbs)
Power-to-Weight Ratio (PW1) = P1/W1

Model 3 Long Range:
Power = P2 (in HP)
Weight = W2 (in lbs)
Power-to-Weight Ratio (PW2) = P2/W2

    The acceleration improvement goal is for PW2 to be equal to or better than PW1. This implies:
    P2/(W2 - x) = P1/W1

Where x is the weight you want to remove from the Model 3 Long Range.

    You can rearrange this formula to solve for x:
    x = W2 - (P2 * W1) / P1

However, for this formula to be of use, we need exact power (HP) figures for both cars, and their respective weights.

As of my last training cut-off in September 2021, here's a rough idea:

    Model 3 Performance has around 450+ HP (though this varies by source and Tesla doesn't provide exact figures).
    Model 3 Long Range AWD, while less powerful, is around the 346 HP ballpark.
    Weight of the Model 3 Performance is around 4,036 lbs.
    Weight of the Model 3 Long Range is slightly less, around 4,000 lbs (this varies based on specific features and versions).

Plugging these numbers in:
x = 4000 - (346 * 4036) / 450
x = 4000 - 3103
x â‰ˆ 897 lbs

This suggests you'd need to remove almost 900 lbs from the Long Range to achieve the same power-to-weight ratio as the Performance.

Remember, this is a rough and oversimplified estimate. The real world involves many other variables like torque curves, aerodynamics, tire grip, weight distribution, software controls, etc. Achieving the same 0-60 mph time as the Performance model by just shedding weight is very unlikely.
