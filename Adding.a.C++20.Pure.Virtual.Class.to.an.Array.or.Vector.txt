Adding a C++20 pure virtual class to a `std::vector` requires a bit of understanding of how pure virtual classes (often referred to as abstract classes) and `std::vector` work in C++. Let's break down the process:

### Understanding Pure Virtual Classes in C++

1. **Pure Virtual Class Definition**: A pure virtual class (or abstract class) is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It is typically used as a base class for other classes.
   - **Example Declaration**:
     ```cpp
     class AbstractClass {
     public:
         virtual void pureVirtualFunction() = 0;
         // Other members...
     };
     ```

### Understanding `std::vector`

1. **Vector Characteristics**:
   - Designed to hold objects of a single type.
   - Requires the objects to be copyable or movable unless pointers are used.

### Adding Pure Virtual Classes to `std::vector`

1. **Direct Storage Is Impossible**: You cannot directly store instances of an abstract class in a `std::vector` since abstract classes cannot be instantiated.

2. **Using Pointers**:
   - **Method**: Store pointers to the abstract class in the vector. These can be raw pointers, but smart pointers are preferred for memory management.
   - **Smart Pointer Advantage**: `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` handle memory allocation and deallocation automatically.

3. **Example Using Smart Pointers**:
   ```cpp
   #include <memory>
   #include <vector>

   class AbstractClass {
   public:
       virtual void pureVirtualFunction() = 0;
       virtual ~AbstractClass() = default; // Virtual destructor for proper cleanup
   };

   class ConcreteClass : public AbstractClass {
   public:
       void pureVirtualFunction() override {
           // Implementation...
       }
   };

   int main() {
       std::vector<std::unique_ptr<AbstractClass>> myVector;

       myVector.push_back(std::make_unique<ConcreteClass>());
       // Add more derived objects...

       return 0;
   }
   ```

### Considerations

1. **Memory Management**: When using pointers, especially raw pointers, be careful with memory management to avoid leaks.
2. **Object Slicing**: Directly storing derived objects in a vector can lead to object slicing if not using pointers.
3. **Polymorphic Behavior**: Pointers allow the vector to hold different derived types, enabling polymorphism.

### Conclusion

- To add a pure virtual class to a `std::vector`, use pointers (preferably smart pointers) to store instances of derived classes.
- Direct storage of abstract class instances in a vector is not possible due to the nature of abstract classes.
