**Q:** 
```cpp 
const int b{};
const int c{};
const int a = b + c;
```
How can i rewrite this c++23 expression such that it's successful compilation indeed proves, for all integers , the sum of two integers is an integer ?

**A:** To rewrite the C++23 expression `const int b{}; const int c{}; const int a = b + c;` in a way that proves the sum of two integers is always an integer, you can use the `static_assert` keyword along with the `std::is_same` type trait. Here's how you can modify the code:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

int main() {
    const int b{};
    const int c{};
    const int a = b + c;
    
    static_assert(std::is_same_v<decltype(a), int>, "The sum of two integers is always an integer");
}
```

In this modified code:

1. We include the `<type_traits>` header to gain access to the `std::is_same` type trait.

2. We define constants `b` and `c` as integers using empty brace initialization, which initializes them to zero.

3. We calculate the sum of `b` and `c` and store the result in the constant `a`.

4. We use `static_assert` to perform a compile-time assertion. The first argument to `static_assert` is a boolean expression that must evaluate to `true` for the compilation to succeed. In this case, we use `std::is_same_v<decltype(a), int>` to check if the type of `a` is the same as `int`.
   - `decltype(a)` retrieves the type of the expression `a`.
   - `std::is_same_v<T1, T2>` is a convenient shorthand for `std::is_same<T1, T2>::value`, which evaluates to `true` if `T1` and `T2` are the same type.

5. The second argument to `static_assert` is an optional string literal that serves as an error message if the assertion fails.

If the `static_assert` passes, meaning the sum of two integers is indeed an integer, the compilation will succeed. If the assertion fails, the compilation will fail with an error message indicating that the sum of two integers is not an integer.

By using `static_assert` with `std::is_same`, we can prove at compile-time that the sum of two integers is always an integer. If the type of `a` is not `int`, the `static_assert` will fail, and the compilation will not proceed.

Note that this code assumes C++17 or later, as `std::is_same_v` is a feature introduced in C++17. If you are using an earlier version of C++, you can replace `std::is_same_v<T1, T2>` with `std::is_same<T1, T2>::value`.

**Q:** How can i combine the proof and the expression into the same module, for convenience ?

**A:** To combine the proof and the expression into the same module, you can use a function template with a `static_assert` inside the function body. This way, the proof will be checked whenever the function is instantiated with integer types. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <type_traits>

template <typename T, typename U>
auto add(T a, U b) {
    static_assert(std::is_integral_v<T> && std::is_integral_v<U>,
                  "Arguments must be integers");
    auto sum = a + b;
    static_assert(std::is_same_v<decltype(sum), std::common_type_t<T, U>>,
                  "The sum of two integers is always an integer");
    return sum;
}
```

In this code:

1. We define a function template `add` that takes two template parameters `T` and `U`, representing the types of the arguments.

2. Inside the function body, we use `static_assert` with the `std::is_integral_v` type trait to ensure that both `T` and `U` are integral types (integers). If either of the arguments is not an integer, the compilation will fail with the provided error message.

3. We calculate the sum of `a` and `b` and store the result in the variable `sum`.

4. We use another `static_assert` to check if the type of `sum` is the same as the common type of `T` and `U` using `std::common_type_t`. This assertion ensures that the sum of two integers is always an integer.

5. Finally, we return the `sum`.

Now, whenever you call the `add` function with integer arguments, the `static_assert` statements will be checked at compile-time. If the assertions pass, the compilation will succeed, proving that the sum of two integers is always an integer.

Here's an example of how you can use the `add` function:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = 5;
    long y = 10;
    auto result = add(x, y);
    // The type of result will be long, as it is the common type of int and long
}
```

In this example, `x` is an `int`, and `y` is a `long`. When `add` is called with `x` and `y`, the `static_assert` statements inside the function will be checked. If the assertions pass, the compilation will succeed, and the sum will be returned.

By combining the proof and the expression into a function template, you can conveniently ensure that the addition operation is only performed on integer types and that the result is always an integer.
