**Q:** You have failed to mention Kamala Harris spouse, Douglas Imhoff -- why ? 

**A:** I did not mention Douglas Emhoff, Kamala Harris's spouse, in the context of vice presidential picks because the focus was on potential running mates who could complement her candidacy and bring additional strengths to the ticket. Douglas Emhoff, as the Second Gentleman, plays a supportive role in Harris's personal and professional life but is not considered for a vice presidential role.

If you'd like information on how Douglas Emhoff contributes to her public image or other aspects of their partnership, I can provide that as well.

**Q:** Douglas Imhoff as the Second Gentleman has been vetted and has political experience.

**A:** While Douglas Emhoff has significant experience as the Second Gentleman, including being actively involved in political and social initiatives, he is not typically considered for a vice-presidential role. His contributions focus on supporting Kamala Harrisâ€™s agenda, advocating for causes like access to justice and combating anti-Semitism, and representing the administration in various capacities. His role, while influential, is more supportive and ceremonial, rather than a potential candidate for the vice-presidency.

If you need a detailed overview of his political and social contributions, please let me know.
