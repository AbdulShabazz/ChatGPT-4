ChatGPT-4:
When inserting a new data point onto a formant chart for use in phones for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, the choice between cloning nearby data points and inserting data points with default values depends on the specific requirements of your TTS system and the characteristics of the phoneme represented by the new data point. Here are some considerations to guide your decision:

### Cloning Nearby Data Points

1. **Pros:**
   - **Continuity:** Ensures a smoother transition in the formant space, which can be crucial for natural-sounding speech.
   - **Contextual Relevance:** Nearby data points likely represent similar phonetic contexts, making them a more accurate starting point.

2. **Cons:**
   - **Potential Overfitting:** May lead to overfitting to specific phonetic contexts, reducing the system's generalizability.
   - **Manual Adjustment Needed:** Cloned values often require fine-tuning to accurately represent the new phoneme.

### Inserting Data Points with Default Values

1. **Pros:**
   - **Simplicity:** Easier to implement as it doesnâ€™t require analysis of nearby data points.
   - **Consistency:** Default values provide a consistent baseline across different phonemes.

2. **Cons:**
   - **Lack of Contextual Accuracy:** Default values might not accurately represent the nuances of the new phoneme.
   - **Additional Calibration Required:** May require more extensive calibration to fit into the existing formant landscape.

### Recommendations for TTS Synthesis

- **Phonetic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed phonetic analysis of the new phoneme. Understand its acoustic characteristics and how it fits into the language's phonetic inventory.
- **Prototype and Test:** Initially, try both methods (cloning and default values) in a controlled setting. Evaluate the synthesized speech quality for naturalness and intelligibility.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Regardless of the initial method, iterative refinement based on feedback from listening tests is crucial.
- **Data-Driven Adjustments:** Consider using machine learning techniques to adjust formant values based on a larger dataset of spoken examples.

### Conclusion

The decision should be informed by the specific requirements of your TTS system and the linguistic characteristics of the phoneme in question. Both methods have their merits and drawbacks, and often a combination of both, followed by rigorous testing and refinement, yields the best results in TTS synthesis.
