**Q:** How have KORG keyboards advanced since the studio 88 was released ?

**A:** Korg has made significant advancements in their keyboards since the release of the Korg Studio 88 (part of the Korg Triton series), which was introduced in the late 1990s. Here are the key areas of advancement:

### 1. **Sound Engine and Sampling Technology:**
   - **Expanded PCM Memory:** Modern Korg keyboards feature significantly larger PCM memory, allowing for more detailed and realistic samples. For example, the Korg Kronos, introduced in 2011, has multiple gigabytes of PCM data, compared to the much smaller sample sizes in earlier models like the Triton Studio.
   - **Multiple Sound Engines:** Current flagship models like the Korg Kronos and Nautilus incorporate multiple sound engines (e.g., AL-1, SGX-2, MOD-7) that cater to different types of synthesis (analog modeling, piano modeling, FM synthesis, etc.). This contrasts with the Triton’s single HI (Hyper Integrated) synthesis engine.
   - **Virtual Memory Technology:** Korg’s newer keyboards use SSD storage and virtual memory technology to allow for instant access to large sample libraries without the limitations of traditional RAM.

### 2. **User Interface and Workflow Enhancements:**
   - **Touchscreen Displays:** Modern Korg workstations like the Kronos and Nautilus feature large, high-resolution color touchscreens, improving user interaction and making navigation more intuitive compared to the monochrome screens on older models.
   - **Improved Sequencer:** The sequencing capabilities have expanded with more tracks (up to 16 MIDI and 16 audio tracks), better integration with digital audio workstations (DAWs), and more sophisticated editing tools.
   - **Set List Mode:** Korg introduced a Set List mode in the Kronos, which allows performers to organize sounds and settings for live performance, a feature that was not available in the Triton Studio series.

### 3. **Polyphony and Performance Power:**
   - **Increased Polyphony:** Modern Korg keyboards offer much higher polyphony, often exceeding 120 voices across different engines, allowing for more complex and layered performances without note dropouts.
   - **Enhanced Processing Power:** The CPU and DSP power have dramatically improved, enabling more complex effects chains, faster loading times, and real-time control over more parameters.

### 4. **Connectivity and Integration:**
   - **USB and MIDI Enhancements:** Current Korg workstations offer enhanced MIDI integration, USB audio interfaces, and the ability to integrate directly with DAWs. They also support USB storage devices for easy transfer of files.
   - **Software Integration:** Korg keyboards now come with deeper integration with software, including plug-ins that mirror hardware functions (e.g., Korg Gadget), providing a seamless transition between studio and live performance.

### 5. **Build Quality and Design:**
   - **Improved Keybed Design:** Newer models have more advanced keybed mechanisms, such as the RH3 weighted keys, which offer a more authentic piano feel compared to earlier models.
   - **Durability and Portability:** Korg has also worked on making their keyboards more durable while reducing weight, making them more suitable for gigging musicians.

### 6. **New Series and Product Lines:**
   - **Korg Kronos/Nautilus Series:** These flagship workstations have become the successors to the Triton series, offering a combination of advanced synthesis, sampling, and sequencing capabilities.
   - **Korg Krome and Kross:** These models offer more affordable options with a balance of sound quality, features, and portability, aimed at different segments of musicians.
   - **Expanded Analog and Hybrid Options:** Korg has also diversified its product range by revisiting analog synthesis (e.g., Korg Minilogue, Prologue) and hybrid systems that combine analog and digital technologies.

### 7. **Software and Firmware Updates:**
   - **Ongoing Support:** Korg continues to provide firmware updates for their keyboards, adding new features, improving stability, and ensuring that the instruments remain relevant years after their release.

These advancements reflect Korg’s ongoing commitment to innovation, blending traditional synthesis methods with cutting-edge digital technology to meet the evolving needs of musicians.
