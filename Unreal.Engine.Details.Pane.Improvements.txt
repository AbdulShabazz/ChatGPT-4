Here are some ways that Unreal Engine could better integrate the Details panel into the main editor UI:

* **Make it more discoverable.** The Details panel is a powerful tool, but it can be easy to overlook, especially for new users. One way to make it more discoverable would be to add a new button to the main toolbar that opens the Details panel directly. Another option would be to make the Details panel more prominent in the editor layout by default.
* **Improve the search functionality.** The Details panel includes a search bar, but it could be more powerful and user-friendly. For example, it would be helpful to be able to filter search results by property type, category, or other criteria. It would also be nice to be able to save and load custom search filters.
* **Provide more context-aware information.** The Details panel currently displays a generic set of properties for the selected object. However, it would be more helpful if the Details panel could provide more context-aware information, such as displaying the most relevant properties for the selected object's type or current context. For example, if a Material is selected, the Details panel could display properties related to the Material's shader graph.
* **Allow users to customize the Details panel.** The Details panel is currently very customizable, but it would be even more powerful if users could customize it to their specific needs. For example, it would be helpful to be able to add or remove properties from the Details panel, or to rearrange the properties in a different order.
* **Make it more integrated with other editor tools.** The Details panel is currently a relatively isolated tool. However, it would be more powerful and user-friendly if it were more integrated with other editor tools. For example, it would be helpful to be able to directly open the Details panel for an object from within other tools, such as the Material Editor or the Blueprint Editor.

In addition to these specific suggestions, it would also be helpful to get feedback from Unreal Engine users on how they would like to see the Details panel improved. This feedback could be used to inform future development of the Details panel and the Unreal Engine editor as a whole.
