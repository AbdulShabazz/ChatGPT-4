**Q:** What are some recent results in QFT and quantum gravity ?

**A:** Recent developments in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) and Quantum Gravity have led to several significant breakthroughs, reflecting the ongoing efforts to unify these foundational aspects of modern physics.

1. **Advances in Quantum Gravity**:
   - **Quadratic Gravity**: One of the notable advancements involves a deeper understanding of quadratic gravity, a variant of quantum gravity theories. Researchers have developed new techniques to calculate the physical running of couplings within this framework, which helps in understanding the high-energy behavior and the analytic structure of scattering amplitudes. This work is seen as a step towards establishing a quantum field theory that fully incorporates gravity, addressing long-standing challenges in integrating gravity into the quantum framework [oai_citation:3,A new technique to calculate the physical running of couplings in quadratic gravity](https://phys.org/news/2024-07-technique-physical-couplings-quadratic-gravity.html).

   - **2D Quantum Gravity**: Another significant breakthrough comes from the mathematical proof that the 2D version of quantum gravity, described by Liouville quantum field theory, is a valid and fully functional model. This model, which has been under exploration since the 1980s, allows physicists to make precise predictions about the behavior of quantum fields in two-dimensional spacetime. This advancement not only provides insights into quantum gravity but also has implications for string theory and the broader understanding of quantum fields [oai_citation:2,Mathematicians Prove 2D Version of Quantum Gravity Really Works | Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-prove-2d-version-of-quantum-gravity-really-works-20210617/).

2. **Intersection of Quantum Information and Gravity**:
   - Recent studies have highlighted the confluence of quantum information theory with quantum gravity, especially through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This correspondence suggests that spacetime and gravity might emerge from the quantum information dynamics of an underlying system. This perspective has provided new ways to tackle problems like the black hole information paradox and has led to the discovery of novel constraints on quantum field theories, such as the quantum null energy condition. These insights are reshaping our understanding of both quantum field theory and general relativity, driving new research directions in theoretical physics [oai_citation:1,Quantum Information, Quantum Field Theory and Gravity | ICTS](https://www.icts.res.in/program/qftg).

These developments indicate a vibrant and rapidly evolving field, where advances in mathematical techniques and cross-disciplinary approaches are helping physicists inch closer to a unified theory of quantum gravity.
