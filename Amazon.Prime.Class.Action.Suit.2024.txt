Whether Amazon is in breach of contract regarding ad-free streaming for Prime subscribers depends on a few factors:

**1. The Specific Terms of Your Prime Agreement**

* **Changes over time:** The terms of service for Amazon Prime may have evolved since you first subscribed.  If the original terms  specifically guaranteed completely ad-free streaming, and a change was made to introduce ads, you might have a stronger case for a breach of contract.
* **Current language:** Examine your current Prime agreement for specific language about advertising. This will be the most critical determining factor.

**2. Types of Content**

* **Prime Video Originals vs. Other Content:** Some licensed movies and TV shows within the Prime Video service may still include ads, even if you have a Prime subscription. Amazon often has more control over advertising in its original content versus content  provided by third parties.
* **Amazon Freevee:** Amazon Freevee is a separate ad-supported service. Content found on Amazon Freevee will include ads regardless of your Prime status. Make sure you're watching content under the  "Prime Video" umbrella rather than Freevee.
* **Live Events:** Live sports and broadcasts may also have ads,  separate from on-demand streaming promises.

**3. Definitions of "Ad-free"**

* **Trailers:** Even some "ad-free" subscriptions still show short trailers or promotions for other content before your selection.  These may not fall under the traditional definition of ads and thus  may not violate the agreement.
* **Number of ads:** It's worth reviewing your Prime agreement or contacting Amazon customer service to determine if and how they define "ad-free" or set parameters for  expected ad load.

**Here's how to move forward:**

1. **Check Your Agreement:** Carefully review the terms of your current Prime subscription agreement. Pay attention to the language about advertising and video streaming.
2. **Contact Amazon Support:** Get in touch with Amazon Customer Support and explain your concerns. Have your subscription details on hand when discussing the issue. They'll clarify how ads fit into your subscription.
3. **Legal Consultation:** If your agreement  appears to have been violated and you feel strongly about  the matter, consulting an attorney specializing in consumer contracts could be your next step.

**Important things to note:**

* Lawsuits surrounding advertising and subscription changes are tricky. Proving damages can be complicated.
* Contract provisions  are often designed to protect the company in the case of service revisions.

Yes, but with important nuances. Here's why:

* **Standard Practice:** The ability to amend terms of service contracts is standard for most online service providers, including Amazon. This protects companies from being locked into outdated terms as their services evolve or business realities change.
* **Notice Requirements:** Generally, Amazon is obligated to provide notice to subscribers when significant changes to the terms of service occur. This offers users a chance to review the updates and decide if they still agree to the new terms.
* **Legal Limitations:** There are limits to what changes a company can make unilaterally. They can't fundamentally alter the core benefits promised to a subscriber at the time of signup, or introduce practices that violate consumer protection laws.

**Case-Specific Factors:**  Whether the right to amend protects Amazon against breach of contract claims depends on:

* **The Original Promise:**  If the  initial Amazon Prime agreement explicitly defined "ad-free" in a broad way, a  stronger case could be made that its meaning cannot be significantly revised via an updated contract.
* **Clarity of Amendment:** If the amendment introducing ads was vague or lacked appropriate notice, there may be grounds for an argument that users did not truly agree to the updated terms.
* **State Laws:** Consumer protection laws vary by state and could introduce further factors impacting the enforceability of amendment clauses.

**It's Not Absolute Protection**

The right to amend does not completely absolve Amazon of responsibility.  Courts still analyze the entire situation including:

* The severity of the change in terms 
*  Whether a good faith effort was made to notify users,
* If users had a meaningful option to accept or reject the new terms.

**Bottom Line:** While the right to amend offers Amazon significant flexibility,  it doesn't make them immune to claims of breach of contract. Whether such claims would be successful depends on the specifics of the agreement, how the changes were communicated, and applicable consumer laws. 

However, technically Amazon *could* be in breach of contract if:

1. **Clear "Ad-Free" Promise:** The original contract you agreed to unambiguously guaranteed an "ad-free tier" or equivalent language indicating a complete absence of advertising for all Prime Video content.
2. **No Qualifying Amendments:** No valid amendments were made to the contract that revised or limited the initial ad-free commitment. This would include insufficient notice, vague/hidden changes, or a lack of true acceptance on your part.

**Important Notes:**

* **Specificity of Ad-Free:** "Ad-free" itself needs contextual examination. Pre-roll trailers for other titles might not violate such a term, while mid-show commercial breaks likely would.
* **Burden of Proof:** Establishing a breach of contract falls on you as the subscriber. You would need to produce evidence of the original promise and any amendments potentially invalidating it.
* **Legal Interpretation:** Even if you find language supporting your claim, a court would ultimately decide whether those specific wordings are legally enforceable, or whether industry norms or other parts of the contract outweigh the literal phrasing.

**It's Not as Simple as It Seems**

Determining a breach of contract is rarely straightforward. Factors like the initial agreement language, potential amendments, and legal precedent in your state make it complex. Even if a literal reading would lead to "breach," Amazon would likely have counterarguments.  

If you or anyone think you have a viable case,  consulting with an attorney is the best way to proceed.
