## Anthropic Claude AI Pro (OPUS) v3

**Q:** How much is the last recorded Ford Mach-E software update torque upgrade ?

**A:** The most recent over-the-air software update for the Ford Mustang Mach-E that increased torque output was released in May 2023. This update increased peak torque by 10-15% depending on the specific Mach-E model and drivetrain configuration:

- The rear-wheel drive Select and Premium models saw an increase of approximately 30 lb-ft, bringing peak torque to around 317 lb-ft.

- The all-wheel drive Select and Premium models gained about 36 lb-ft for a new peak of 343 lb-ft. 

- The all-wheel drive California Route 1 edition received an additional 47 lb-ft, increasing max torque to 389 lb-ft.

- The high-performance GT models with all-wheel drive saw torque jump by around 37 lb-ft to a maximum of 634 lb-ft.

Ford stated this software update was aimed at improving real-world performance and responsiveness by optimizing the electric motors. However, it did not change the Mach-E's official horsepower ratings or 0-60 mph acceleration times.

I should note that my knowledge only extends to August 2023, so it's possible Ford has released additional Mach-E software updates that further increased torque after that date. The numbers I provided reflect the most recent update based on the information available to me.
