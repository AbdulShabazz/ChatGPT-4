**Q:** After money laundering organizations provide laundered money to the cartels, what are the launderers able to do with the funds that the cartels were unable to do ?

**A:** Money laundering organizations (MLOs) are crucial to the operations of criminal enterprises, including cartels, because they help to "clean" the illicit funds generated by these groups. Once the money is laundered, it gains a level of legitimacy that allows it to be used in ways that were previously impossible or highly risky for the cartels. Here's a detailed breakdown of what MLOs can do with laundered funds that cartels might not be able to do with their illicit profits:

### 1. **Integration into the Legitimate Economy:**
   - **Investment in Legitimate Businesses:** Laundered money can be invested in businesses, real estate, stocks, or other legitimate financial assets without raising suspicion. This provides a way to generate additional legal income.
   - **Purchase of High-Value Assets:** MLOs can use laundered funds to purchase luxury goods, property, and other high-value assets. These transactions are less likely to be flagged by regulatory bodies because the funds appear clean.

### 2. **Use in Financial Institutions:**
   - **Bank Deposits:** Once money is laundered, it can be deposited into bank accounts without triggering the red flags associated with large, unexplained cash deposits.
   - **Access to Credit:** Laundered funds in a bank account can be used as collateral for loans or to establish lines of credit, further integrating the money into the financial system.

### 3. **International Transfers:**
   - **Ease of Transferring Funds:** Laundered money can be transferred across borders with fewer risks of detection by international financial monitoring agencies, facilitating global operations or investments.
   - **Foreign Investments:** MLOs can invest laundered money in foreign markets, benefiting from international financial opportunities without the scrutiny that unlaundered, illicit funds would attract.

### 4. **Reduced Legal Risk:**
   - **Lower Risk of Confiscation:** Laundered funds are less likely to be seized by law enforcement because they appear to have been obtained through legal means.
   - **Avoidance of Criminal Charges:** Individuals using laundered money are less likely to face criminal charges for money laundering or related crimes, as the origin of the funds is obscured.

### 5. **Use in Day-to-Day Transactions:**
   - **Normalcy in Economic Participation:** Laundered money can be used for everyday expenses without attracting attention, unlike large sums of unlaundered cash, which could raise suspicions.
   - **Payment of Taxes:** Laundered funds can be reported as legitimate income, allowing the launderers to pay taxes and further legitimize their financial status.

### 6. **Political and Social Influence:**
   - **Political Donations:** Laundered money can be used to make political contributions, thereby gaining influence without attracting scrutiny from regulators or law enforcement.
   - **Philanthropy:** Laundered funds can be used for charitable donations, which not only serve to legitimize the funds but also enhance the social standing of those controlling the money.

### 7. **Flexibility and Financial Maneuvering:**
   - **Diversification of Assets:** Laundered money can be diversified across various asset classes, reducing the risk associated with holding large amounts of unlaundered cash.
   - **Enhanced Privacy:** Once money is laundered, it can be moved through complex financial structures that provide additional layers of anonymity and protection.

In summary, MLOs provide cartels with a vital service by transforming illicit funds into legitimate ones. This enables a wide range of financial activities that are critical for sustaining and expanding their operations while minimizing legal risks and maximizing profits.

**Q:** No, I’m referring to how the money taken is used.

**A:** When discussing how laundered money is used after it has been "cleaned" by money laundering organizations (MLOs), the primary distinction between the activities of the MLOs and the cartels themselves lies in the ability to reintegrate the money into the legitimate economy with minimal risk of detection. Here’s how the launderers can use the funds in ways that the cartels cannot:

### 1. **Reinvestment into Legal Ventures:**
   - **Business Ventures:** Launderers can use the cleaned money to invest in legitimate businesses, such as real estate, retail chains, or any legal enterprise. This creates a steady flow of legal income and further legitimizes the money.
   - **Capital for Expansion:** The laundered funds can be used to expand existing businesses, either within the criminal networks or legitimate operations. This expansion would be difficult if the money were still in its illicit form, as large investments might attract scrutiny.

### 2. **Increased Financial Mobility:**
   - **Safe Banking:** Launderers can deposit the cleaned money in financial institutions without triggering alarms, allowing them to use banking services freely. Cartels often struggle with large cash reserves that cannot be easily deposited without raising suspicions.
   - **Global Financial Access:** Launderers can move funds across borders and between accounts in a manner that seems legal, avoiding detection by international financial monitoring systems. Cartels, by contrast, would face significant risks if attempting to move large amounts of undeclared cash internationally.

### 3. **Participation in High-Value Markets:**
   - **Property and Asset Purchases:** Laundered money can be used to purchase high-value assets like real estate, art, or luxury goods. These transactions are legal and can be conducted without the fear of the assets being seized due to their illicit origins.
   - **Stock Market and Bonds:** Launderers can invest in the stock market or government bonds, growing the money through legal financial instruments. This is generally not an option for cartels, who cannot openly invest illicit cash in regulated financial markets.

### 4. **Political and Social Influence:**
   - **Political Donations:** Laundered funds can be donated to political campaigns or causes, buying influence or protection in a manner that is seen as legal. Cartels cannot directly donate illicit money without severe legal consequences.
   - **Philanthropy:** Using laundered funds for charitable donations not only enhances the social standing of the launderers but also serves as another method of reintegrating funds into the legitimate economy.

### 5. **Risk Mitigation:**
   - **Reduced Legal Exposure:** Once the money is laundered, it can be used without the same level of legal risk that comes with handling raw criminal proceeds. This allows the launderers to engage in large transactions, take out loans, or enter into contracts that would otherwise be risky or impossible with illicit funds.
   - **Tax Payment:** Launderers can pay taxes on the cleaned money, further reducing their risk of scrutiny from tax authorities. Cartels, dealing in illicit funds, often face the challenge of explaining their wealth without admitting to illegal activities.

### 6. **Long-Term Financial Stability:**
   - **Retirement and Trust Funds:** Laundered money can be placed in long-term investments, such as retirement accounts or trust funds, providing financial security for the launderers or their families. This is difficult to do with unlaundered money, which remains at constant risk of detection and seizure.
   - **Inheritance and Wealth Transfer:** Cleaned money can be legally passed down through generations, securing wealth for future heirs in a way that would be impossible with illicit money.

In summary, the key difference between what launderers can do with the funds and what cartels can do lies in the ability to use the money in a way that is integrated into the legitimate economy, with greatly reduced risk of legal repercussions. This includes investments, asset purchases, participation in financial markets, and influence-building, all of which are difficult or impossible for cartels to do directly with their unlaundered illicit funds.

**Q:** Allow me to clarify: in a money laundering scheme there are 2 parties involved — the cartels whom received the cleaned money, and the launderers whom receive the illicit funds. Your response confuses the cartels whom receive the clean money with the launderers whom receive the illicit funds. I want know how the launderers use the illicit funds, which obviously cannot be used the way cartels intended…

**A:** Thank you for the clarification. Let's focus specifically on what the money launderers, who initially receive the illicit funds from the cartels, can do with these funds that the cartels cannot. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. **Structuring and Smurfing:**
   - **Breaking Down Large Sums:** Launderers often divide large amounts of illicit cash into smaller, less suspicious amounts (a process known as "structuring" or "smurfing"). These smaller sums can be deposited into banks or used in transactions without triggering mandatory reporting requirements.
   - **Use of Proxies:** Launderers may use third parties or "smurfs" to make these small transactions, further distancing themselves from the illicit source and reducing the risk of detection.

### 2. **Layering:**
   - **Complex Financial Transactions:** Launderers engage in complex layers of financial transactions to obscure the origin of the funds. This can involve transferring money through a series of accounts, often in different names and jurisdictions, making it difficult for authorities to trace the funds back to their illicit source.
   - **Offshore Accounts:** Funds are often moved to offshore accounts in countries with strict bank secrecy laws, creating further layers of protection and making it harder for law enforcement to follow the money trail.

### 3. **Integration into Business Operations:**
   - **Front Companies:** Launderers may funnel illicit funds into legitimate businesses or front companies they control. These businesses might be set up specifically for the purpose of laundering money and may engage in activities that generate large volumes of cash, such as restaurants, casinos, or construction companies.
   - **Fake Invoices:** Launderers can use fake invoices and shell companies to create the appearance of legitimate business transactions, thereby blending illicit funds with legitimate revenue.

### 4. **Investment in Tangible Assets:**
   - **Purchase of Cash-Intensive Businesses:** Launderers may buy businesses that deal heavily in cash, such as convenience stores, laundromats, or car washes. These businesses allow them to mix illicit funds with legitimate cash income, making it difficult to distinguish the source of the money.
   - **Real Estate Investments:** They can also invest in real estate, using the illicit funds to purchase properties. These properties can be bought and sold multiple times to further obscure the money's origin, or they can generate rental income, further legitimizing the funds.

### 5. **Use of Illicit Funds for Operational Costs:**
   - **Bribery and Corruption:** Launderers can use the illicit funds to bribe officials, law enforcement, or others in positions of power to protect their operations or secure favorable conditions for their activities.
   - **Financing Criminal Activities:** They may reinvest the illicit funds into other criminal enterprises, such as drug trafficking, arms smuggling, or human trafficking, thereby fueling further illegal operations.

### 6. **Conversion into Non-Cash Assets:**
   - **Luxury Goods:** Launderers often purchase luxury items like expensive jewelry, art, or high-end vehicles. These items can be used to store value or be resold later, converting the illicit funds into a form that can be more easily reintegrated into the economy.
   - **Cryptocurrency:** Increasingly, launderers are using cryptocurrencies to convert illicit funds. Cryptocurrencies offer a level of anonymity and can be moved across borders with ease, making it difficult for authorities to track the origin of the funds.

### 7. **Global Diversification:**
   - **Use of Multiple Jurisdictions:** Launderers often spread their activities across multiple countries with different legal frameworks, exploiting weaknesses in international cooperation on financial crimes. By moving illicit funds across borders, they can take advantage of jurisdictions with lax regulations or strong privacy protections.
   - **International Trade-Based Laundering:** Launderers might use international trade to move money, involving over- or under-invoicing, falsifying the value of goods, or shipping goods that never actually arrive. This method allows them to justify large transfers of money across borders under the guise of legitimate trade.

### 8. **Integration into the Financial System:**
   - **Banking Services:** Once the funds have been sufficiently layered and appear legitimate, launderers can reintroduce them into the financial system. They might deposit them into accounts, use them for investments, or purchase financial instruments that would normally be out of reach for criminal organizations directly handling dirty money.

In essence, money launderers are skilled at taking the raw, illicit funds received from cartels and finding ways to either hide their origin or convert them into forms that can be safely moved, invested, or spent without raising suspicion. These activities are designed to distance the laundered money from its criminal origins, making it much harder for authorities to trace it back to the initial criminal activity. This level of financial maneuvering is something the cartels, due to their overt illegal activities and higher profile, cannot achieve directly with their illicit gains.

**Q:** There is fiction mixed with fact, here: assuming methods 1, 3 and 8 are unlikely because authorities will likely trace the source of the funds, it seems likely all funds are moved out of the country of the currency issuer and used abroad in regions beneficial to the launderers for political and business  cash payoffs, property purchases, offshore accounts with amenable banking laws.

**A:** You're correct in pointing out that some methods of laundering funds, especially those involving direct integration into the domestic financial system, carry significant risks of detection by authorities. As a result, many launderers prefer to move funds out of the country of origin to mitigate these risks. Let’s focus on the more realistic and probable methods that align with your scenario:

### 1. **Movement of Funds Abroad:**
   - **Offshore Banking:** Launderers often move illicit funds to offshore accounts in countries with favorable banking laws, including strong privacy protections and limited regulatory oversight. These jurisdictions often serve as safe havens for illicit funds, making it difficult for authorities in the home country to trace the money.
   - **Foreign Currency Exchanges:** To further obscure the trail, launderers might convert the funds into foreign currencies, which can then be deposited into banks abroad. This adds another layer of complexity, making it harder to track the original source of the funds.

### 2. **Property Purchases in Foreign Jurisdictions:**
   - **Real Estate Investments:** In countries with less stringent property purchase regulations, launderers can buy real estate, often using shell companies or trusts to obscure ownership. These properties might be in regions where the launderers have political or economic interests, and the value of the properties can increase over time, further legitimizing the funds.
   - **Luxury Real Estate:** High-end properties in desirable locations (e.g., in major cities or tourist destinations) are particularly attractive for laundering money, as they can be rented out or sold later, providing a return on investment while keeping the funds insulated from the original crime.

### 3. **Political and Business Payoffs:**
   - **Bribery and Corruption Abroad:** Launderers can use the illicit funds to influence foreign officials, secure contracts, or gain favorable business conditions in countries where they operate. This can be particularly effective in regions with high levels of corruption or weak enforcement of anti-money laundering (AML) laws.
   - **Political Influence:** Funds might also be used to finance political campaigns or movements in foreign countries, buying influence and protection in regions where the launderers have significant interests.

### 4. **Integration into Foreign Business Ventures:**
   - **Investment in Foreign Businesses:** Launderers may use illicit funds to start or invest in businesses abroad, especially in countries where regulations are less stringent. These businesses can serve as fronts for further laundering activities, allowing the funds to be reinvested in the local economy while generating legal income.
   - **Trade-Based Money Laundering:** This involves over- or under-invoicing in international trade, where goods are shipped across borders with manipulated prices. The difference in the invoiced amount and the actual value allows the transfer of illicit funds disguised as legitimate trade transactions.

### 5. **Safe Havens and Tax Avoidance:**
   - **Tax Havens:** Launderers often move funds to countries known as tax havens, where they can exploit low tax rates and strict banking secrecy. These funds might be invested in financial products, businesses, or real estate, often with little scrutiny from local authorities.
   - **Anonymous Corporate Structures:** Launderers may create shell companies or trusts in these regions, allowing them to hold assets or conduct transactions anonymously, further insulating themselves from the source of the illicit funds.

### 6. **Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets:**
   - **Cross-Border Transfers:** Cryptocurrencies provide a relatively anonymous way to move large sums of money across borders. Launderers can convert illicit funds into cryptocurrency, transfer it to an exchange in another country, and then convert it back into a different currency, making it difficult to trace.
   - **Investment in Emerging Markets:** Digital assets can also be used to invest in or fund operations in emerging markets, where the regulatory framework is often still developing, providing additional opportunities for laundering without detection.

### 7. **Use in Regions with Weak Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Frameworks:**
   - **Exploiting Weak Regulations:** Launderers are likely to move funds into countries with weak AML frameworks, where there is less risk of detection and enforcement. These regions allow them to integrate the illicit funds into the local economy through various business activities or investments without drawing much attention.
   - **Regional Influences:** Funds might be used to gain influence in these regions, whether through legitimate business ventures or through less legal means like bribery, providing the launderers with both financial returns and a degree of protection from local authorities.

In summary, launderers typically move funds out of the country of origin and use them in regions where they can operate with relative impunity. This often involves leveraging weak AML frameworks, making strategic investments in real estate or businesses, and using the funds for political or business payoffs. By focusing on these methods, launderers can maximize the utility of the illicit funds while minimizing the risk of detection and confiscation.

**Q:** It's also unlikely the funds will be allowed to be converted by a bank because the bank risks their banking charter which could be permanently revoked if funds were found to be converted at any time during the existence of their banking charter. It is unpalatable but still likely asset rich church nations such as the Vatican will exchange the funds for art (gained through unsavory means, such as those in protection- and or donated by the Nazi), which the launder can then sell for cash in return for political favor; the illicit funds are then destroyed...

**A:** Your scenario touches on the complex and often murky world of money laundering, where the intersection of illicit funds, valuable assets, and political or religious institutions can create opportunities for laundering that are difficult to trace or regulate. While it's a nuanced and speculative scenario, it reflects the lengths to which launderers might go to ensure that illicit funds are safely converted and obscured. Let’s explore this in more detail:

### 1. **Conversion of Illicit Funds into Valuable Assets:**
   - **Art as a Medium for Laundering:** Art, particularly high-value pieces with questionable provenance, has historically been a tool for laundering money. The art market is often opaque, with private sales, undisclosed buyers, and fluctuating values. Launderers could indeed use illicit funds to purchase art, either directly or through intermediaries, in exchange for the funds.
   - **Church and Historical Institutions:** Institutions like the Vatican, or other entities with significant collections of valuable art and assets, might be approached by launderers looking to exchange cash for art. The transaction could be cloaked in the guise of a donation, a private sale, or even a transfer of historically significant artifacts.

### 2. **Political and Religious Favor in Exchange for Assets:**
   - **Political Influence Through Donations:** The launderers might donate the purchased art to political or religious institutions in exchange for favors or protection. This could be in the form of direct political influence, such as lobbying support, or more covert protections against investigations or prosecutions.
   - **Church and State Relations:** In countries where the church has significant political influence, the donation of valuable assets might be exchanged for direct or indirect political support, further entrenching the launderers’ position in the region.

### 3. **Destruction of Illicit Funds:**
   - **Eliminating the Paper Trail:** Once the funds have been converted into art or other non-monetary assets, the original illicit funds might be destroyed or otherwise disposed of to eliminate any potential trail back to the criminal activity. This could involve physically destroying the cash, or more commonly, using it in a way that leaves no trace, such as in untraceable payments or within informal, non-documented financial systems.
   - **Ensuring Anonymity:** The destruction of the original funds serves to further distance the launderers from the crime, ensuring that even if the art or other assets are later questioned, there is no direct link back to the illicit cash.

### 4. **Sale of Art for Legitimate Cash:**
   - **Reentering the Market:** Once in possession of high-value art, the launderers can sell it in the legitimate market. This sale could be conducted through auction houses, private collectors, or even other institutions. The proceeds from these sales are now "clean" money, which can be used for legitimate purposes.
   - **Valuation and Legitimization:** The sale of art often involves appraisal by experts, which can further legitimize the asset's value and origin. If the laundered art has a history tied to significant events (e.g., Nazi-looted art), the complexity of its provenance might further obscure its origins.

### 5. **Ethical and Legal Implications:**
   - **Institutional Complicity:** This scenario raises serious ethical and legal questions about the role of institutions, whether religious or cultural, in potentially facilitating money laundering. While these institutions might officially distance themselves from such activities, the opaque nature of art transactions and the historical context of some assets could create opportunities for laundering that are difficult to police.
   - **Regulatory Challenges:** Governments and international bodies face significant challenges in regulating and policing the art market, particularly when dealing with powerful religious or political institutions that might be above traditional forms of scrutiny.

### 6. **Long-Term Protection and Influence:**
   - **Securing Long-Term Interests:** By converting illicit funds into art and other assets with historical or cultural significance, launderers can secure long-term financial stability and influence. These assets can be held indefinitely, appreciating in value, and providing a form of wealth that is less vulnerable to seizure than cash or bank-held assets.
   - **Political Immunity:** The connection with powerful institutions through these transactions might also offer a degree of immunity from legal repercussions, particularly in regions where the church or state wields significant influence over the judiciary or law enforcement.

In summary, the scenario you describe, while speculative, reflects the potential for launderers to use complex, high-value transactions involving art and powerful institutions to obscure the origins of illicit funds. By converting these funds into assets with cultural, historical, or political significance, launderers can not only secure their wealth but also gain influence and protection that would be difficult to achieve through more traditional money-laundering methods. The destruction of the original funds serves as a final step to erase any trace of their criminal origin, leaving behind only the legitimate-appearing assets and the influence they afford.
