**Q:** What is Materials Nexus new non rare earth magnet composed of ?

**A:** Materials Nexus has developed a new rare earth-free permanent magnet called MagNex. However, the specific composition of MagNex has not been disclosed in the available sources. The development process involved using an AI platform to identify and analyze over 100 million compositions of potential rare earth-free permanent magnet candidates, focusing on addressing industry challenges such as supply chain security, cost, performance, and environmental issues[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11].

The AI-driven approach allowed Materials Nexus to design, synthesize, and test MagNex in just three months, significantly faster than traditional methods. The resulting magnet can be produced at 20% of the material cost and with 70% less carbon emissions compared to current rare earth element magnets[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11].
