**Q:** If an assassin gains an attempt at the u.s. president, should the Secret Service advisor be obligated and or forced to resign ?

**A:** The question of whether a Secret Service advisor should be obligated or forced to resign if an assassination attempt on the U.S. president occurs is complex and depends on several factors. Here are the key considerations:

1. **Accountability and Responsibility**:
    - **Scope of Role**: Determine the specific responsibilities of the advisor. If their role directly includes preventing such attempts, their accountability might be higher.
    - **Failure of Duty**: Assess whether there was a failure in fulfilling their duties. Did the advisor neglect any critical aspects of their job?

2. **Circumstances of the Attempt**:
    - **Nature of the Attempt**: Understand how the attempt was made. Was it due to a failure in intelligence, security protocol, or an unforeseen method?
    - **Preventative Measures**: Evaluate whether all reasonable and necessary preventative measures were in place and followed.

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
    - **Historical Performance**: Consider the advisor's track record. Have they consistently performed well in their duties, or were there previous lapses?
    - **Investigation Outcomes**: Wait for the results of a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the security breach.

4. **Institutional Integrity**:
    - **Maintaining Trust**: The resignation might be necessary to maintain or restore public trust in the Secret Service.
    - **Leadership Responsibility**: Sometimes, leadership changes are made to signify accountability and facilitate organizational improvements.

5. **Legal and Ethical Standards**:
    - **Ethical Considerations**: Beyond legal obligations, ethical standards might dictate resignation if there's clear evidence of negligence.
    - **Legal Requirements**: Ensure that any action taken is in line with legal frameworks governing the employment and responsibilities of Secret Service personnel.

Ultimately, whether a Secret Service advisor should be obligated or forced to resign would depend on a detailed assessment of their individual role, the specifics of the security breach, and the outcomes of any investigations into the incident.

**Q:** An assassin gaining access to a rooftop to gain a vantage point with respect to the physical disposition of the president would be within the purview of special mitigation tactics of the Secret Service advisor, would it not ??

**A:** Yes, an assassin gaining access to a rooftop to gain a vantage point with respect to the physical disposition of the president would indeed fall within the purview of the special mitigation tactics of the Secret Service advisor. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Responsibilities of the Secret Service Advisor**:
    - **Threat Assessment**: The advisor is responsible for assessing potential threats, including elevated vantage points that could be used for assassination attempts.
    - **Security Protocols**: Ensuring that all security protocols are in place to mitigate such risks, including securing rooftops and other high-risk areas.
    - **Surveillance and Reconnaissance**: Overseeing surveillance and reconnaissance activities to identify and neutralize potential threats before they materialize.

2. **Mitigation Tactics**:
    - **Access Control**: Implementing strict access control measures for rooftops and other high vantage points.
    - **Sniper Teams and Countermeasures**: Deploying sniper teams or other countermeasures to monitor and secure these areas.
    - **Coordination with Local Authorities**: Working closely with local law enforcement and property owners to secure buildings and rooftops along the presidential route or near locations where the president will be present.

3. **Scenario Planning and Drills**:
    - **Scenario-Based Training**: Conducting regular training and drills based on various threat scenarios, including attacks from elevated positions.
    - **Pre-Event Security Sweeps**: Performing thorough security sweeps of all buildings and rooftops in the vicinity of the president's movements.

4. **Intelligence Gathering**:
    - **Pre-Event Intelligence**: Gathering intelligence on any potential threats or suspicious activities that could indicate a plan to use a rooftop for an attack.
    - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Utilizing real-time monitoring tools and intelligence feeds to stay informed about any emerging threats.

Given these responsibilities, the Secret Service advisor plays a critical role in preventing such scenarios. If an assassin is able to gain access to a rooftop and attempt an attack, it would suggest a failure in these mitigation tactics. Consequently, this would warrant a thorough investigation to determine where the breakdown occurred and whether the advisor should be held accountable.
