To add a new line to an existing Verizon Unlimited Ultimate plan, you will need to pay the following:

* **$40/month line access fee**
* **One-time activation fee of $40**

You may also be eligible for a promotional discount on the line access fee, depending on the current promotions that Verizon is offering. For example, Verizon is currently offering a $15/month discount on each line for customers who have four or more lines on their account.

If you are adding a new phone to your account, you will also need to pay for the cost of the phone. Verizon offers a variety of financing options, so you can choose to pay for the phone in full or over time.

Here is an example of the total cost to add a new line to an existing Verizon Unlimited Ultimate plan:

* Line access fee: $40/month
* Activation fee: $40 (one-time)
* Phone cost: $600 (financed over 24 months)

**Total cost per month:** $40 + $600/24 = **$50/month**

Note that this is just an example. The actual cost of adding a new line to your account may vary depending on the current promotions that Verizon is offering and the cost of the phone that you choose.

To add a new line to your account, you can visit the Verizon website, call customer service, or visit a Verizon store.
