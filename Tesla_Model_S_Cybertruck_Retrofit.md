Retrofitting a Tesla Model S with a Tesla Cybertruck steering wheel involves both technical and legal considerations. Technically, such modifications are possible with the right expertise, tools, and parts. However, there are several challenges and considerations:

1. **Compatibility**: The steering wheel from a Cybertruck may not be directly compatible with the Model S's steering column, electronics, and airbag system. Modifications would likely be needed to ensure that the Cybertruck steering wheel fits and functions properly in a Model S.

2. **Safety**: Steering wheels are critical safety components, integrated with airbags and designed to meet specific safety standards. Modifying or replacing a steering wheel can affect the operation of the airbag and other safety systems. Any modification should ensure that the safety features remain fully operational.

3. **Legalities**: In many regions, modifying safety equipment like steering wheels is subject to regulatory approval. Changes to the steering mechanism might need to be inspected and approved by relevant authorities to ensure they meet safety standards. Additionally, such modifications could affect the vehicle's insurance status or warranty.

4. **Expertise**: Properly executing such a modification requires a high level of automotive engineering expertise. It's not just a matter of physically swapping the steering wheels; the electrical connections, compatibility with the vehicle's computer systems, and safety features all need to be carefully considered and maintained.

Given these factors, it's important to consult with professionals who specialize in automotive modifications and understand the specific legal and safety requirements in your area. They can provide advice on whether such a modification is feasible, safe, and legal, and what it would entail in terms of cost and modifications to the vehicle's systems.
