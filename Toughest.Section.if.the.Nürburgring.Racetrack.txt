Bard:

The toughest section of the Nürburgring for professional racers is a matter of opinion, but some of the most commonly cited include:

* **Kallenhard:** This corner is located about five miles into the track and is known for its late apex and tight exit. Drivers have to be very precise in their line through this corner or risk going off track.
* **Foxhole:** This section of the track features five sweeping corners that can be taken at full speed, but the tricky part comes at the last corner, where the track goes into a steep downhill descent followed by a steep elevation. This abrupt change in elevation can be very difficult to handle, even for experienced drivers.
* **Karussell:** This corner is a 180-degree hairpin turn that is preceded by a long straight. Drivers have to brake very hard and quickly turn the car around before accelerating out the other side.
* **Fuchsröhre:** This corner is a double-apex corner that is located in a wooded section of the track. Drivers have to be very careful in this corner because it is easy to lose sight of the track exit.
* **Pflantzgarten:** This section of the track features a series of high-speed corners that are followed by a long straight. Drivers have to be very precise in their line through these corners or risk going off track.

In addition to these specific sections, the Nürburgring as a whole is considered to be a very challenging track due to its length, elevation changes, and blind corners. Professional racers have to be at the top of their game to be successful on this track.

Ultimately, the toughest section or turn of the Nürburgring for professional racers is the one that they find the most difficult to master. There is no one definitive answer, as it depends on the individual driver's strengths and weaknesses.
