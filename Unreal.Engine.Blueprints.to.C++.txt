There is no official Unreal Engine tool or plugin to convert blueprints to C++. However, there are a few third-party tools and plugins that can help you with this task.

One popular option is the **Unreal Engine Blueprint to C++ Converter** plugin by **CodeLikeMe**. This plugin allows you to convert individual blueprints to C++ code, or to convert entire projects. It also provides a number of features to help you with the conversion process, such as automatic code generation and syntax highlighting.

Another option is the **BPC** tool by **Quixel**. This tool is not a plugin, but it can be used to convert blueprints to C++ code. It is a more powerful tool than the Unreal Engine Blueprint to C++ Converter plugin, but it is also more complex to use.

It is important to note that no blueprint to C++ converter is perfect. There will always be some manual work required to convert a blueprint to C++ code. However, these tools can save you a lot of time and effort, especially if you have a large number of blueprints to convert.

Here are some additional tips for converting blueprints to C++:

* Start by understanding the basics of C++. This will help you to understand the generated C++ code and to make any necessary modifications.
* Use the documentation for the Unreal Engine API to learn about the C++ classes and functions that you need to use.
* Test the converted C++ code frequently to make sure that it is working as expected.

If you are new to C++, or if you are having trouble converting a blueprint to C++, there are a number of resources available to help you. There are tutorials, online courses, and forums where you can ask questions and get help from other Unreal Engine developers.
