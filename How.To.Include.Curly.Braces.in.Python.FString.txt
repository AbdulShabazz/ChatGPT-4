Including curly braces in a Python f-string requires a specific syntax, as the curly braces `{}` are used for expressing variables or expressions whose values are to be embedded in the string. To include literal curly braces in your f-string, you need to double them. Here's how you do it:

- **To Include Curly Braces `{}` Literally in an f-string:**
  - Use `{{` to represent a literal `{`
  - Use `}}` to represent a literal `}`

- **Example Usage:**
  1. **With a Variable:**  
     - Suppose you have a variable `value = 10`
     - To include this in an f-string with curly braces:  
       `f_string = f"The value is {{ {value} }}"`
     - This will result in: `"The value is { 10 }"`

  2. **Without a Variable:**  
     - If you just want to include empty curly braces:  
       `f_string = f"Example of empty braces: {{}}"`
     - This will result in: `"Example of empty braces: {}"`

- **Explanation:**
  - The double curly braces `{{` or `}}` are interpreted as literal braces in the f-string.
  - When Python processes the f-string, it converts double braces into single ones.

Using this method, you can seamlessly include curly braces in your f-strings without interfering with the string formatting syntax of Python.
