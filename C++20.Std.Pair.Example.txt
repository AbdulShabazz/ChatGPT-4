`std::pair` is a utility class in C++ that provides a way to store two heterogeneous objects as a single unit. It is a part of the `<utility>` header. A `std::pair` can be useful in situations where you want to tie two values together without creating a full struct or class. With C++20, there haven't been significant changes to how `std::pair` is used compared to earlier versions, but I'll show you an example that utilizes C++20 features such as structured bindings and `constexpr`.

Here's an example that demonstrates creating a pair of an `int` and a `std::string`, adding them to a vector, and then iterating over the vector to print the pairs:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <utility> // For std::pair
#include <vector>

int main() {
    // Create a vector of std::pair<int, std::string>
    std::vector<std::pair<int, std::string>> items;

    // Adding items to the vector
    items.emplace_back(1, "Apple");
    items.emplace_back(2, "Banana");
    items.emplace_back(3, "Cherry");

    // Iterating over the vector using a range-based for loop and structured bindings (C++17 onwards)
    for (const auto& [key, value] : items) {
        std::cout << "Key: " << key << ", Value: " << value << std::endl;
    }

    // Example of accessing elements of a pair
    auto myPair = std::make_pair(10, "Orange");
    std::cout << "The pair contains: " << myPair.first << " and " << myPair.second << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This example covers the following:
- Creation of `std::pair` objects and adding them to a `std::vector`.
- Use of `emplace_back` to construct `std::pair` objects in place.
- Iteration over the vector of pairs using a range-based for loop and structured bindings to extract the `int` and `std::string` elements of each pair.
- Use of `std::make_pair` to create a pair.

This code is compatible with C++20 and demonstrates basic usage of `std::pair` along with some modern C++ features.
