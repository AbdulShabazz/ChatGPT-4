**Q:** What happens to the outstanding shares of a public company if the stock is issued a compliance notice and is subsequently delisted ?

**A:** When a public company is issued a compliance notice by the stock exchange where it is listed, it means that the company is not meeting certain listing requirements or regulations. This could be due to various reasons, such as failing to maintain a minimum share price, not filing financial reports on time, or not meeting corporate governance standards.

If the company fails to address the issues raised in the compliance notice within a specified time frame, the stock exchange may proceed to delist the company's stock. When a stock is delisted, it is removed from the exchange, and the shares can no longer be traded on that particular exchange.

However, the outstanding shares of the company still exist, and the ownership of those shares remains with the shareholders. The consequences for shareholders when a stock is delisted can vary:

1. The shares may be traded over-the-counter (OTC) on less regulated markets, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or the Pink Sheets. However, these markets often have lower liquidity and less transparency.

2. The value of the shares may decline significantly due to reduced liquidity and investor confidence.

3. It can become more difficult for shareholders to sell their shares, as there may be fewer buyers in the OTC markets.

4. The company may choose to buy back the outstanding shares from the shareholders, often at a lower price than the market value before delisting.

5. In some cases, the company may file for bankruptcy, which could lead to shareholders losing most or all of their investment.

It's important to note that delisting does not necessarily mean that the company has gone bankrupt or ceased to exist. The company may continue to operate, but without the benefits and obligations of being listed on a major stock exchange.
