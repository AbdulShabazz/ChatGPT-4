**Q:** How is a world Olympic qualifier different from a national Olympic qualifier ?

**A:** A world Olympic qualifier and a national Olympic qualifier are two different types of events used to select athletes for the Olympic Games. Here are the main differences:

1. Participation: World Olympic qualifiers are open to athletes from all countries, while national Olympic qualifiers are limited to athletes from a specific country.

2. Competition level: World Olympic qualifiers typically feature a higher level of competition since they include the best athletes from around the globe. National qualifiers have a more limited pool of athletes.

3. Qualification criteria: World Olympic qualifiers often have specific qualifying standards set by the international governing body of the sport. National Olympic qualifiers may have their own qualification criteria set by the country's national governing body, which can be different from the international standards.

4. Number of events: There are usually fewer world Olympic qualifiers compared to national qualifiers. Some sports may have only one world qualifier, while others may have several. In contrast, each country typically holds its own national qualifier.

5. Timing: World Olympic qualifiers are typically held closer to the Olympic Games to ensure athletes are at their peak performance. National qualifiers may be held earlier to allow time for selected athletes to prepare for the Olympics.

Both world and national Olympic qualifiers serve the purpose of selecting the best athletes to represent their countries at the Olympic Games, but they differ in terms of participation, competition level, qualification criteria, number of events, and timing.

**Q:** Can an athlete that fails to qualify at the world Olympic qualifier compete in their national Olympic qualifier, and vice versa ?

**A:** Yes, an athlete who fails to qualify at the world Olympic qualifier can usually still compete in their national Olympic qualifier, and vice versa. Here's why:

1. Multiple qualification pathways: Most sports offer several ways for athletes to qualify for the Olympics. These may include world championships, world rankings, continental championships, and national trials. Failing to qualify through one pathway doesn't necessarily disqualify an athlete from other pathways.

2. National selection criteria: Each country's national Olympic committee and sports federations set their own criteria for selecting their Olympic team. These criteria may consider factors beyond just the results of the world Olympic qualifier, such as past performances, national competition results, and other discretionary factors.

3. Timing: National Olympic qualifiers often take place after the world Olympic qualifiers. This allows athletes who didn't qualify at the world event to have another chance to qualify at the national level.

4. Quota spots: Each country is allocated a certain number of spots (quotas) for each sport at the Olympics. If an athlete qualifies at the world level, that often secures a quota spot for their country, but not necessarily for that specific athlete. The national qualifier may be used to determine which athlete fills that quota spot.

However, it's important to note that in some cases, national Olympic committees may set their qualification standards higher than the international ones. In such cases, an athlete who qualified at the world level might still need to compete at the national qualifier to confirm their spot on the Olympic team.
