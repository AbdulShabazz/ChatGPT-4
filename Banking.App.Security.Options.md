**Q:** On iOS is it more secure to 1. offload my banking app, and download as required; 2. Download and reinstall; or 3. leave installed (without offload) ?

**A:** When it comes to securing a banking app on iOS, each of the options you mentioned has its advantages and disadvantages. Let's evaluate them from a security standpoint:

### 1. **Offload the Banking App and Download as Required**
- **Security Benefits:**
  - **Reduced Attack Surface:** Offloading the app removes it from your device, reducing the potential attack surface. If your device were to be compromised, the app (and its sensitive data) wouldn't be present.
  - **Preservation of Data:** Offloading an app keeps its data on your device while removing the app itself. This could be beneficial if you want to keep login credentials or other settings without having the app constantly on your device.

- **Security Drawbacks:**
  - **Data Remains:** The app's data remains on your device, which could be a target if your device is compromised.
  - **Temporary Exposure:** When you re-download the app, there's a brief window where the app could be compromised if your device is under attack at that time.

### 2. **Download and Reinstall the Banking App Each Time**
- **Security Benefits:**
  - **Clean Installation:** Each time you reinstall the app, you start with a clean slate. This can be beneficial in avoiding any potential vulnerabilities or corruption that could occur with a long-installed app.
  - **No Persistent Data:** Unlike offloading, this option does not keep any residual data on the device, reducing the risk if your device is compromised.

- **Security Drawbacks:**
  - **Increased Exposure During Installation:** Every time you download the app, you are potentially exposing yourself to a compromised network or other threats during the download process.
  - **Inconvenience:** Constantly downloading and reinstalling the app can be time-consuming and inconvenient.

### 3. **Leave the Banking App Installed (Without Offload)**
- **Security Benefits:**
  - **Regular Updates:** Keeping the app installed allows you to receive updates automatically, which can include important security patches.
  - **Reduced Exposure:** With the app installed, there's no need to re-download it over potentially insecure networks. The app is also less likely to be tampered with during a reinstall process.

- **Security Drawbacks:**
  - **Persistent Presence:** The app remains on your device at all times, making it a target if your device is compromised.
  - **Possible Data Exposure:** Any cached data or stored information within the app could be accessed if your device security is breached.

### **Conclusion:**
- **Most Secure Option:** **Download and reinstall the app as needed**. This approach minimizes persistent data and ensures you're using a clean installation each time. However, it can be inconvenient.
  
- **Balanced Option:** **Offloading the app**. This strikes a balance between convenience and security by reducing the app’s presence while preserving settings/data.

- **Least Secure but Convenient Option:** **Leave the app installed**. This is the most convenient but carries a higher risk since the app and its data are always present on your device.

For the highest security, especially if you’re very cautious about the security of your banking information, downloading and reinstalling is the best option. However, for everyday practicality, offloading the app when not in use is a good compromise.
