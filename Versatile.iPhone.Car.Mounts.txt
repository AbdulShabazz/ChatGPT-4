Can you recommend an automotive iPhone stand which does not obstruct recording the road and or interior?

ChatGPT:

Certainly! If you're looking for an automotive iPhone stand that doesn't obstruct recording the road or the vehicle's interior, consider the following types:

    Windshield Mount: These typically use suction cups to attach to your windshield. The camera can face forward without obstruction. Just ensure the placement does not block your field of vision while driving.

    Dash Mount: Some mount directly on the dashboard without obstructing the forward view. The mount's height and angle adjustments can ensure clear recording.
        Recommendation: "RAM Mounts X-Grip with Twist Lock Suction Cup Base"

    Vent Mount: These clip onto the car's air vents. While more discreet and out of the driver's field of vision, they might be slightly limiting when recording the road due to their lower position.
        Recommendation: "Belkin Car Vent Mount PRO with MagSafe"

    Headrest Mount: If you're keen on recording the vehicle's interior, specifically the back seat, a headrest mount might be ideal.

Make sure the stand you choose is compatible with the size of your iPhone, especially if you have a particularly large or small model. Additionally, when recording while driving, always prioritize safety and ensure the stand doesn't impede your view or distract you from the road. Also, note that in some regions, attaching anything to the windshield may be against local regulations. Always check local laws before using any mount in a vehicle.

Can you recommend one which supports horizontal and or landscape view-based recording of the road and interior ?

ChatGPT:

Certainly! If you're interested in a mount that allows for both portrait and landscape orientations (horizontal and vertical) for recording the road and the interior, you'd want a mount with a rotating or pivoting head. Here are a couple of versatile mounts that can achieve this:

    iOttie Easy One Touch 4 Dash & Windshield Car Mount: This was mentioned in the previous list, but it's worth emphasizing its versatility. The mount has a telescopic arm and a pivoting head, allowing you to easily switch between portrait and landscape orientations. It's a very popular choice due to its ease of use and stability.

    Arkon RoadVise Car Dash Mount Holder: This holder is known for its robust build and its ability to grip phones securely. The RoadVise has an adjustable viewing angle and can be oriented in both portrait and landscape modes. It can be attached either to the windshield or dashboard.

    Quad Lock Car Mount: This is a versatile solution, especially if you already have a Quad Lock case for your iPhone. The Quad Lock system is unique in its approach, providing a secure and stable mount. The car mount offers a 360-degree swivel, making it easy to rotate your phone between portrait and landscape views.

Remember, always place your mount in a location where it won't obstruct your view or interfere with vehicle controls. And it's always a good practice to regularly check the suction or adhesive on mounts to ensure they remain securely in place, especially before starting a recording.
