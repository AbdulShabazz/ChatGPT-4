Yes, race car drivers progressively and strategically increase their speed during the course of a race. This is done for a number of reasons, including:

* **To conserve fuel.** At the start of a race, the cars are carrying full fuel tanks, which can weigh hundreds of pounds. This extra weight can slow the car down, so drivers will start the race at a slower pace to save fuel. As the race goes on and the cars burn fuel, they become lighter and faster. Drivers can then gradually increase their speed to take advantage of this.
* **To warm up the tires.** The tires need to be at a certain temperature in order to grip the track properly. Drivers will start the race at a slower pace to give the tires time to warm up. Once the tires are up to temperature, the drivers can then increase their speed.
* **To learn the track.** Drivers will often start the race at a slower pace to learn the track and get a feel for the conditions. Once they are familiar with the track, they can then increase their speed.
* **To save their equipment.** The cars and engines in racing are very expensive, so drivers need to be careful not to damage them. Starting the race at a slower pace helps to reduce the wear and tear on the equipment.

Of course, there are other factors that can affect a driver's speed during a race, such as the weather, traffic, and the other drivers on the track. However, in general, drivers will progressively and strategically increase their speed during the course of a race.

Here is an example of how a race car driver might increase their speed progressively and strategically during a race:

* **Lap 1:** The driver starts the race at a slower pace to conserve fuel, warm up the tires, learn the track, and save their equipment.
* **Lap 2-5:** The driver gradually increases their speed as the fuel tank lightens, the tires warm up, they become more familiar with the track, and the equipment warms up.
* **Lap 6-10:** The driver is now at a good pace and is starting to push the car to its limits.
* **Lap 11-15:** The driver is now at full speed and is battling the other drivers for position.
* **Lap 16-20:** The driver is still at full speed, but they may need to start conserving fuel again if the race is close.
* **Lap 21-finish:** The driver is pushing the car to its limits to try and win the race.

Of course, this is just a general example. The way a driver increases their speed during a race will vary depending on the specific circumstances.
