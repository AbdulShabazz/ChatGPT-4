How would you explain convolution to a seven year old?

ChatGPT:

Alright, imagine you have a tiny magic window made up of little boxes. Now, imagine you have a big picture with lots of colors and details. To understand a part of that picture better, you slide the tiny window over it. Every time you move the window, it looks at the colors beneath it and makes a new, simpler picture. By sliding this window everywhere on the big picture, we get a new picture that highlights certain features or details. That's kind of like what convolution does in computers!
