Q:My Windows 11 lock screen is stuck on an image.

Absolutely, here's how to fix that and ways to customize your Windows 11 logon screen background:

**Troubleshooting the Stuck Image**

1. **Check the 'Show lock screen background picture on the sign-in screen' Option:**
   - Go to **Settings** (Windows key + I)
   - Navigate to **Personalization** -> **Lock Screen**
   - Under "Personalize your lock screen," make sure the toggle for  "Show lock screen background picture on the sign-in screen" is set to **On**.

2. **Try Windows Spotlight:**
    - In the Lock Screen settings, set the "Personalize your lock screen" dropdown to **Windows Spotlight**.
    - Lock your PC (Windows Key + L) to see if it cycles through new images. 

3. **Restart Windows Explorer:** 
    - Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc).
    - Under the "Processes" tab, find "Windows Explorer".
    - Right-click on "Windows Explorer" and select "Restart".

4. **Reset Lock Screen to Defaults (if necessary):**
   - You'll need some registry editing skills for this. Be cautious, and create a backup of your registry before proceeding.
    - Open Registry Editor (Search for "regedit")
    - Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Personalization`
    - If you see a key named "NoChangingLockScreen", delete it.
    - Restart your PC.

**Changing the Logon Screen Background**

1. **Single Image:**
   - Open **Settings** -> **Personalization** -> **Lock Screen**.
   - Under "Personalize your lock screen" select **Picture**.
   - Click "Browse Photos" and choose the desired image.

2. **Slideshow:**
   - Same steps as above, but select **Slideshow** instead of "Picture".
   - Choose a folder containing your images.

**Important Things to Remember**

* The logon screen background is separate from your desktop wallpaper.
* Some organizational settings or restrictions might prevent you from customizing the logon screen background.

**Let me know if you'd like more detailed instructions on any of the steps, or if the image is still stuck!**
