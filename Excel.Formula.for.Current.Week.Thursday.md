**Q:** Generate an excel equation which returns Thursday's date for the current week.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Here's an Excel formula that returns Thursday's date for the current week:

```
=TODAY()-WEEKDAY(TODAY(),3)+4
```

This formula does the following:

1. `TODAY()` gives the current date.
2. `WEEKDAY(TODAY(),3)` returns the day of the week as a number (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, etc.), using Monday as the first day of the week.
3. We subtract this number from the current date to get to Monday of the current week.
4. We then add 4 to get to Thursday.

Would you like me to explain how this formula works in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** The formula returns a day which is part of a default January '00 date object .​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You're correct, and I made a mistake in my explanation. Let's address this issue and provide a correct formula.

The problem occurs because Excel treats dates as serial numbers, with January 1, 1900, as day 1. When we use the DAY() function on a number less than 1, Excel interprets it as a day in January 1900.

To fix this and get the correct day of the month for Thursday of the current week, we need to use this formula:

```
=DAY(TODAY()-WEEKDAY(TODAY(),3)+4)
```

This formula is actually correct. The issue you're experiencing is likely due to how the formula is being entered or how the cell is formatted. Here are some steps to ensure it works correctly:

1. Make sure the cell is formatted as a number, not as a date.
2. Enter the formula exactly as shown above.
3. If it still doesn't work, try wrapping the whole formula in the TEXT() function like this:

```
=TEXT(TODAY()-WEEKDAY(TODAY(),3)+4,"d")
```

This last version explicitly formats the result as just the day number.

If you're still having issues, could you please provide more details about what you're seeing? For example, what result are you getting, and what result do you expect? This will help me provide a more accurate solution.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
