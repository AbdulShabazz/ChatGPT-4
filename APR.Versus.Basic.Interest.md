**Q:** What is the technical difference between a loan's interest rate and its APR ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** The interest rate and Annual Percentage Rate (APR) are related but distinct terms when it comes to loans. Here are the key technical differences:

Interest Rate:
- The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the principal loan amount.
- It does not include any fees or additional charges associated with the loan.
- The interest rate can be fixed (remains the same throughout the loan term) or variable (changes based on market conditions).

Annual Percentage Rate (APR):
- The APR is a more comprehensive measure of the cost of borrowing, expressed as an annualized percentage.
- It includes the interest rate plus other fees and charges associated with the loan, such as origination fees, mortgage insurance, closing costs, and discount points.
- The APR provides a more accurate picture of the total cost of the loan over its entire term.
- It allows borrowers to compare loan offers with different fees and interest rates on a consistent basis.

The APR is typically higher than the interest rate because it incorporates additional costs. However, for loans with no fees, the APR and interest rate would be the same.

Lenders are required by law (in most countries) to disclose the APR to borrowers, as it helps consumers compare different loan options and understand the total cost of borrowing. When comparing loans, it's essential to consider both the interest rate and the APR, along with other factors such as loan term, repayment schedule, and any prepayment penalties.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
