There are a few things you can do to increase the performance of this C++20 algorithm:

    Use a faster data structure for the Tasks_Thread queue. The current implementation uses a std::queue data structure, which is a good choice for general-purpose use cases. However, for this particular algorithm, a faster data structure such as a std::priority_queue or a std::unordered_set could be used.
    Use a more efficient algorithm for the lhs_mod_lhs_flag and lhs_call_lhs_flag checks. The current implementation uses a series of nested conditional statements to check if the Theorem[LHS] and Axiom[LHS] values are both divisible by each other and if the CallHistory[Theorem[LHS]][Axiom[LHS]] flag is set to false. A more efficient algorithm could be used, such as a single function call to a std::divmod() function.
    Use a more efficient algorithm for the Tasks_Thread.emplace_back() call. The current implementation uses a single emplace_back() call to add a new element to the Tasks_Thread queue. A more efficient algorithm could be used, such as a push_back() call followed by a pop_front() call.

By making these changes, you should be able to improve the performance of the algorithm significantly.
