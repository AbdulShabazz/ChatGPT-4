## Perplexity AI Pro v2.21.0

**Q:** What is new in the latest Unreal Engine 5.4.2 ?

**A:** Unreal Engine 5.4 introduces a plethora of new features and improvements aimed at enhancing the development experience for game developers, artists, and creators. Here are some of the key updates:

## Animation and Motion Graphics
- **Modular Control Rig**: This new feature allows for the creation of animation rigs from modular parts, simplifying the process compared to using extensive granular diagrams. It also includes automatic retargeting for bipedal characters, making it easier to transfer existing animations to new characters[1][3].
- **Motion Graphics Mode**: This mode includes tools for generating 2D/3D shapes, modifying their geometry and movement, and creating non-linear animations. It features Cloners and Effectors for procedural animation, allowing for complex animations with ease[2].

## Rendering Enhancements
- **Nanite Improvements**: Nanite, the virtualized micropolygon geometry system, now includes an experimental tessellation function for adding fine details like bumps and cracks without altering the original mesh. It also supports variable rate shading for better performance[3][4].
- **Temporal Super Resolution (TSR)**: Performance and stability improvements have been made to TSR, ensuring a more predictable output across different platforms[3].
- **Hardware Ray Tracing**: Significant improvements have been made to hardware ray tracing, offering speed gains and better performance for 60Hz experiences[5].

## Virtual Production
- **Unreal VCam**: The Virtual Camera app, now renamed Unreal VCam, supports Android devices and has added workflow support for macOS. VR Scouting has also been updated with a new toolkit supporting OpenXR HMDs[2].

## Procedural Content Generation (PCG)
- **PCG Biome Core Plugin**: This new plugin allows for the procedural generation of biomes, serving as an advanced example of the latest PCG features. It is highly customizable and serves as a great starting point for complex PCG applications[2].

## Performance Improvements
- **Shader Compilation**: The shader compilation process has been overhauled, resulting in approximately 30% fewer shaders being compiled and significantly faster preprocessing times. This leads to improved project cook times, especially for projects involving shader invalidations[5].
- **CPU Performance**: Unreal Engine 5.4 offers substantial improvements in CPU performance, with some reports indicating a 40% increase in performance[4].

## Additional Features
- **Texture Graph Editor**: This new experimental feature introduces a node-based system for generating or modifying textures within Unreal Engine, eliminating the need for external software[2].
- **Movie Render Graph**: A major update to the movie render graph allows for the setup of render layers using a node-based architecture, enhancing the rendering workflow[1].

These updates collectively make Unreal Engine 5.4 a significant release, offering enhanced tools and performance improvements that benefit a wide range of development activities.
