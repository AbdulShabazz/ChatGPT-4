While iPads with cellular connectivity can handle data, they don't directly support traditional cellular voice calls. Here's why, and how you can still make calls with your iPad:

**Technical Limitations:**

* **Hardware:** Current iPad models lack the specific voice call processing hardware typically found in smartphones. 
* **Focus:** iPads are designed primarily for data-centric activities like browsing, streaming, and productivity, not as phone replacements.

**Workarounds - How to Make Voice Calls on an iPad**

1. **Wi-Fi Calling:** If you have an iPhone and your carrier supports Wi-Fi Calling:
   * Your iPad can use your iPhone's cellular connection to make and receive calls over Wi-Fi
   * Check these Apple Support pages for setup:
     * Make and receive phone calls on iPad - Apple Support: [https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/make-and-receive-phone-calls-ipadf97892b2/ipados](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/make-and-receive-phone-calls-ipadf97892b2/ipados)
     * Allow phone calls on your iPad and Mac - Apple Support: [https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/allow-phone-calls-on-your-ipad-and-mac-iphf90f372f0/ios](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/allow-phone-calls-on-your-ipad-and-mac-iphf90f372f0/ios)

2. **Voice over IP (VoIP) Apps:**  Services like Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc., let you make voice or video calls over the internet using your iPad's data connection (cellular or Wi-Fi).

**Possible Future Developments:**

It's not impossible for Apple to integrate voice calling into future iPad models, but there's no indication this will happen anytime soon. Factors Apple likely consider:

* **Market Demand:** Is there a significant desire for iPads to replace phones?
* **Technical hurdles:**  Would adding voice call hardware compromise other iPad features?
* **Cannibalization:** Would a voice-calling iPad reduce iPhone sales?

**Let me know if you'd like more details on any of the workaround methods!**
