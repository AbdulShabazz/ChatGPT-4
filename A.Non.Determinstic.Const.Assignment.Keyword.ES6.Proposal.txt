In JavaScript, the `const` keyword is used to declare a constant variable. However, the characteristics of `const` in JavaScript are such that it must be initialized at the time of declaration, and its value cannot be reassigned later. This behavior is by design, ensuring immutability of the value bound to the `const` variable once it's set.

Given your requirement, there isn't a direct way to achieve a "latent" assignment with `const`. The variable must be initialized at declaration and cannot change thereafter. However, you can approximate the behavior you're describing using a combination of closures and functions. This approach allows for a one-time assignment of a value, after which the value remains constant.

Here's an example of how you might implement this:

```javascript
function createConst() {
    let value; // holds the value internally
    let isSet = false; // flag to track if the value has been set

    return {
        setValue: function(newValue) {
            if (!isSet) {
                value = newValue;
                isSet = true;
            } else {
                throw new Error("Cannot reassign a const variable.");
            }
        },
        getValue: function() {
            return value;
        }
    };
}

// Usage
const myConst = createConst();

// Initially assign a value
myConst.setValue(10);

// Retrieve the value
console.log(myConst.getValue()); // Outputs: 10

// Attempting to reassign throws an error
try {
    myConst.setValue(20);
} catch (e) {
    console.error(e.message); // Outputs: Cannot reassign a const variable.
}
```

In this example:
- A `createConst` function is used to encapsulate the mutable state.
- The `setValue` function allows setting the value once, after which it cannot be changed.
- The `getValue` function provides access to the value.

This pattern mimics a `const`-like behavior where the value can be set once and then effectively becomes immutable for the rest of its scope. It's worth noting that this is a workaround and doesn't use the actual `const` keyword for its intended purpose. The `const` keyword in JavaScript is designed for variables that should not be reassigned and must be initialized at the time of declaration.

Considering the proposed variance of `const` behavior for inclusion in the ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) standard involves evaluating its utility, compatibility with existing language constructs, and the overall philosophy of JavaScript as a language. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Consistency with Language Design**: JavaScript's `const` declaration, as it currently stands, aligns with the language's design philosophy of clarity and simplicity. It provides a straightforward way to declare variables whose values are not meant to be changed after their initial assignment. Changing this could introduce complexity and ambiguity.

2. **Utility and Need**: The existing functionality of `const`, `let`, and `var` covers most use cases in JavaScript. The scenario you described - a variable that starts uninitialized and becomes immutable once set - is relatively niche. While it might be useful in certain situations, it's not clear if the demand justifies changing the standard.

3. **Implementation Complexity**: Introducing a new variable behavior would require changes in JavaScript engines and could impact performance optimizations related to constant variables. JavaScript engines often optimize for `const` variables differently than for `let` or `var`, assuming their values won't change.

4. **Potential for Confusion**: Adding another form of `const` with different behavior could be confusing to developers, especially those new to the language. JavaScript's popularity is partly due to its relatively low barrier to entry, and maintaining this is a consideration for language changes.

5. **Backward Compatibility**: Any change to the language needs to maintain backward compatibility. Introducing a new behavior for `const` could potentially break existing code or change its meaning, which is generally avoided in language design.

6. **Alternative Solutions**: The functionality you're describing can be achieved through closures or encapsulating the behavior in a class or function, as demonstrated previously. The ability to create such structures may reduce the need to modify the language itself.

7. **Community and Ecma TC39 Process**: Changes to the JavaScript language are governed by proposals to the Ecma Technical Committee 39 (TC39). New features go through a rigorous process, starting with a proposal stage and moving through several stages of scrutiny and refinement. Community input and consensus are crucial in this process.

In conclusion, while the idea is interesting and could have specific use cases, its inclusion in the ES6 standard (or any future iteration of ECMAScript) would require thorough consideration of these factors. Given the existing language features and the potential challenges with such a change, it may not be seen as a necessary addition to the standard. However, this doesn't diminish the creativity or utility of the concept in specific scenarios. For changes to be considered, they would typically need to demonstrate significant benefit to a wide range of developers and use cases.
