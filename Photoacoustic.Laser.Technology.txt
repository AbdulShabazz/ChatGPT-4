The technology you're referring to is known as "Laser Sound Transmission" or "Photoacoustic Effect." It's a method of producing sound by using a laser to heat a surface, typically a metal plate, causing the air around it to expand and create sound waves. Here's how it works in detail:

1. **Laser Generation**: A modulated laser beam is generated. The modulation encodes the sound signal into the laser.

2. **Material Interaction**:
   - The laser is directed at a material, often a metal plate.
   - The choice of material affects the quality and type of sound produced. Metal plates are common due to their ability to absorb laser energy efficiently.

3. **Thermoelastic Effect**:
   - When the laser hits the surface, it causes localized heating.
   - This rapid heating leads to thermal expansion of the surface material.

4. **Sound Wave Creation**:
   - The expansion and contraction of the heated material create pressure waves in the air.
   - These pressure waves are perceived as sound.

5. **Modulation Techniques**:
   - The laser is modulated with an audio signal.
   - The intensity and frequency of the laser correspond to the amplitude and frequency of the sound waves.

6. **Safety and Efficiency**:
   - Safety measures are crucial to prevent laser damage.
   - The efficiency of the process depends on the laser's power, the material's properties, and environmental factors.

7. **Applications**:
   - This technology finds use in directional audio systems.
   - It can transmit sound to a specific location without the need for traditional speakers.

8. **Advantages**:
   - Highly directional sound.
   - No need for physical speakers in the transmission path.

9. **Challenges**:
   - Complexity and cost of laser systems.
   - Safety concerns due to high-intensity lasers.
   - Ambient conditions affecting sound transmission quality.

This technology represents an innovative approach to sound transmission, with potential applications in various fields, from entertainment to communication.
