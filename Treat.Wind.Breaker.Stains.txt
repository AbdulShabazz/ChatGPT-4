To lift a stain from a light colored windbreaker, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the type of stain.** This will help you choose the right treatment method. Some common stains and their treatments include:
    * **Food and drink stains:** Blot up as much of the stain as possible with a clean cloth. Then, apply a mixture of one part liquid laundry detergent and two parts water to the stain. Let it sit for 15-30 minutes, then rinse with cold water.
    * **Grease and oil stains:** Sprinkle cornstarch or baby powder on the stain to absorb the grease. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then brush it off. Apply a small amount of dishwashing soap to the stain and rub it in gently. Let it sit for another 15 minutes, then rinse with cold water.
    * **Ink stains:** Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to a clean cloth and blot the stain. Be careful not to spread the stain. Rinse with cold water.
2. **Pre-treat the stain.** Once you have identified the type of stain, apply the appropriate pre-treatment. For example, you can apply a stain stick to food and drink stains, or dishwashing soap to grease and oil stains. Let the pre-treatment sit on the stain for at least 15 minutes before washing.
3. **Wash the windbreaker.** Wash the windbreaker according to the care instructions on the label. Be sure to use cold water and a mild detergent. If the stain is still visible after washing, you may need to repeat the pre-treatment and washing process.

Here are some additional tips for lifting stains from light colored windbreakers:

* Act quickly. The sooner you treat a stain, the easier it will be to remove.
* Blot, don't rub. Rubbing can damage the fabric and spread the stain.
* Test any stain remover in an inconspicuous area of the windbreaker first to make sure it doesn't damage the fabric.
* Don't put the windbreaker in the dryer until the stain is completely gone. Heat can set the stain.

If you are unable to remove a stain from your light colored windbreaker, you may need to take it to a professional cleaner.
