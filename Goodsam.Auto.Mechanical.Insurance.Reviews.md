**Q:** What are customer reviews of Goodsam mechanical insurance coverage for autos ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Customer reviews of Good Sam's mechanical insurance coverage for autos, specifically the Good Sam Extended Service Plan (ESP), are generally positive, highlighting several key benefits and some areas of concern.

### Positive Reviews
1. **Peace of Mind and Reliability**: Many customers appreciate the peace of mind that comes with having a reliable service plan. They report that Good Sam ESP handles claims efficiently and covers significant repair costs, which often justifies the cost of the policy. For instance, one customer mentioned that the plan paid for a major repair, saving them $597.99, which was half the price of the policy in one repair[7].

2. **Convenience and Coverage**: Customers find the service convenient, especially the ability to choose any repair facility in the U.S. or Canada. The plan also covers mobile mechanics for inoperable RVs, which adds to its convenience[6][7].

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The plan covers a wide range of components, including transmission, drive axle, suspension, steering, and more. This comprehensive coverage is a significant advantage for many users[6].

### Areas of Concern
1. **Exclusions and Limitations**: Some customers express frustration with the exclusions and limitations of the coverage. For example, the plan does not cover cosmetic or structural repairs, and certain components like brake pads and rotors are excluded because they are considered wear-and-tear items[6].

2. **Maintenance Requirements**: The plan requires proper maintenance of the vehicle, and customers must keep receipts for oil changes and tune-ups. Failure to provide these receipts can result in denied claims, which some customers find cumbersome[6].

3. **Use of Refurbished Parts**: The company reserves the right to use refurbished parts for repairs, which may not be acceptable to all customers. Those who prefer new parts may have to pay extra for the upgrade[6].

Overall, while Good Sam's mechanical insurance coverage for autos receives positive feedback for its reliability, comprehensive coverage, and convenience, potential customers should be aware of the exclusions, maintenance requirements, and the possibility of refurbished parts being used in repairs.
