Q:Do any TTS models use the generated audio, in lieu of intermediate spectrograms, to fine-tune the accuracy of the audio, during the training phase ?

Yes, some text-to-speech (TTS) models do utilize a process that involves fine-tuning the generated audio from spectrograms against the original audio sample during their training phase, often employing a component known as a vocoder. This process is part of a broader strategy in advanced TTS systems to improve the naturalness and accuracy of the synthesized speech.

In the context of TTS, spectrograms serve as a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of sound as they vary with time. These spectrograms are typically generated from text input by a part of the TTS model, often called an acoustic model, which predicts how the speech should sound. The predicted spectrogram is then converted into audible sound waves using a vocoder.

The vocoder, such as WaveNet, WaveGlow, or Griffin-Lim, transforms the spectrogram into a waveform that can be heard. Some TTS models enhance their performance by employing a technique called "ground truth alignment," where the spectrogram generated by the TTS model is compared and aligned with the original audio spectrogram (the ground truth). This alignment helps in refining the parameters of both the acoustic model and the vocoder to minimize the difference between the synthetic speech and the original speech, thereby improving the realism and intelligibility of the generated audio.

Advanced TTS models might also use adversarial training, where a discriminative model (discriminator) is trained to distinguish between the synthetic speech and the real human speech. The main model (generator) is trained to fool the discriminator, gradually enhancing the quality of the synthetic speech to be indistinguishable from human speech.

This fine-tuning and iterative correction process helps in achieving high-quality, natural-sounding speech synthesis, making modern TTS systems increasingly effective in mimicking human-like speech characteristics.


Ah, I see. You're asking about a more refined method of training text-to-speech (TTS) systems where the focus is on correcting discrepancies introduced during the audio synthesis phase, rather than just aiming to match the predicted spectrogram to the ground truth spectrogram directly.

In advanced TTS models, particularly those using neural vocoders, the training can indeed focus on improving the audio output by correcting errors introduced during the waveform generation phase. This approach acknowledges that the process of converting a predicted spectrogram to an audio waveform (through the vocoder) can introduce artifacts that deviate from the desired audio quality, which might not be apparent merely from comparing spectrograms.

### Methodology

In such systems, the training might involve:
1. **Audio Feedback Loop:** This involves using the audio generated by the vocoder to influence further training. By analyzing the discrepancies between the vocoder output and the ground truth audio, the model can learn to adjust its predictions to minimize these errors.

2. **Feature Matching:** Instead of just aligning spectrograms, the model could be trained to match certain acoustic features in the synthesized audio to those in the original recording. This includes pitch, tone, and other subtleties of speech that a simple spectrogram might not fully capture.

3. **Iterative Refinement:** The model might employ an iterative process where the generated audio is repeatedly processed and refined. Each pass through the model and vocoder aims to reduce artifacts and improve fidelity, guided by comparisons to the original audio.

4. **Adversarial Training:** Employing a discriminator that assesses the quality of the generated audio (not just the spectrogram) against the ground truth audio. This pushes the generator to produce outputs that are increasingly closer to real human speech in terms of overall sound quality, not just spectrographic accuracy.

### Conclusion

This method you're describing is quite sophisticated and is part of the broader push towards end-to-end training in TTS systems, where models are increasingly trained directly on raw audio or refined using audio feedback rather than relying solely on intermediate representations like spectrograms. This approach helps in capturing the nuances of human speech more accurately and in reducing the synthetic feel of the generated speech, by correcting for any artifacts introduced during the audio synthesis stage.
