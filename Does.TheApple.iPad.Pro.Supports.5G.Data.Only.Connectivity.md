**Q:** Important Clarification: cellular voice- and video- calls are only supported through the Apple Facetime app. Otherwise, 5G cellular connectivity supports data-only services through the carrier.

**A:** Thank you for the clarification! You're absolutely right. While the iPad models I mentioned earlier do support 5G and cellular connectivity, it's important to note that:

* Cellular voice and video calls are only supported through Apple's FaceTime app and not through traditional carrier-based voice and SMS services.
* 5G cellular connectivity on these iPads is primarily intended for data-only services, such as browsing, streaming, and downloading, through the carrier.

I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, and I'll make sure to provide this clarification in the future!
