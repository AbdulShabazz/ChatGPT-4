**Choosing Between the Two**

The ideal choice depends on your sonic preferences, budget, and your setup:

* **Susvara:** If you are seeking absolute sound quality,  have the budget, and already have (or are willing to invest in) a very powerful amplifier, the Susvara is an exceptional choice for audiophiles looking for the best detail and soundstage possible.
