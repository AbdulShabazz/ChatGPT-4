**Q:** Can partial derivatives be viewed as the partial product calculation of a multiplication operation ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Yes, in a sense, partial derivatives can be viewed as analogous to the partial product calculation in a multiplication operation. Here's how:

1. In multiplication, we break down the problem into smaller, more manageable parts called partial products. For example, when multiplying 23 x 45, we calculate 23 x 5 and 23 x 40 separately and then add the results together.

2. Similarly, in multivariate calculus, partial derivatives allow us to break down the rate of change of a function with respect to each of its input variables separately. For a function f(x, y), we can find the partial derivative with respect to x (∂f/∂x) while treating y as a constant, and vice versa for the partial derivative with respect to y (∂f/∂y).

3. Just as partial products are combined to get the final product in multiplication, partial derivatives can be used together to understand the overall behavior of a function and to solve optimization problems. For example, the gradient vector consists of all the partial derivatives of a function, and points in the direction of the steepest ascent.

4. In multiplication, the order of the partial products doesn't affect the final result due to the commutative property. Similarly, for a well-behaved function, the order of taking partial derivatives doesn't matter (i.e., ∂²f/∂x∂y = ∂²f/∂y∂x), a property known as the equality of mixed partials.

However, it's important to note that this analogy has limitations and should not be taken too literally. Partial derivatives are rates of change, while partial products are components of a product. Nonetheless, thinking of partial derivatives as breaking down a complex problem into simpler parts can be a helpful intuition.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) often use reverse gradient descent, which employs partial derivatives, to use sums and sums of products to capture the behavior of a system. Is it possible for artificial neural networks to accelerate the performance of proof searches by using ANNs to capture the relationship behavior between axioms ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Yes, it is possible for artificial neural networks (ANNs) to potentially accelerate the performance of proof searches by capturing the relationship behavior between axioms. This is an active area of research in the field of automated theorem proving and machine learning.

One approach is to use ANNs to learn heuristics for guiding the proof search process. The idea is to train the network on a large dataset of proofs and their corresponding axioms, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships between the axioms and the proof steps. The trained ANN can then be used to predict which axioms or inference rules are most likely to be useful at each step of the proof search, thus helping to prioritize the exploration of the search space.

Here's a high-level overview of how this could work:

1. Data representation: Axioms and proof steps are encoded into a suitable representation that can be fed into the ANN, such as vectors or graphs.

2. Training: The ANN is trained on a dataset of proofs, where the input is the current state of the proof (e.g., the axioms and derived formulas) and the output is the next step in the proof (e.g., the axiom or inference rule to apply).

3. Inference: During the proof search, the trained ANN is used to predict the most promising axioms or inference rules to apply at each step, based on the current state of the proof.

4. Integration: The predictions from the ANN are combined with traditional proof search algorithms, such as resolution or tableau methods, to guide the search process and improve efficiency.

There have been several research papers exploring the use of ANNs for theorem proving and related tasks. For example:

- Loos et al. (2017) used deep learning to guide the proof search in the E automated theorem prover, showing improved performance on certain problem domains.
- Kaliszyk et al. (2018) used a combination of neural networks and traditional proof search methods to automatically discover new mathematical conjectures and prove them.
- Paliwal et al. (2020) developed a graph neural network architecture for learning heuristics in automated theorem proving, demonstrating improved performance on real-world math problems.

However, it's important to note that this is still an emerging area of research, and there are many challenges to overcome, such as the need for large annotated datasets of proofs, the difficulty of encoding complex mathematical concepts into neural network representations, and the potential for the ANN to learn biases or make mistakes. Nonetheless, the use of ANNs to accelerate proof searches by capturing the relationship behavior between axioms is a promising direction with potential for significant advances in automated reasoning and mathematical discovery.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** I'm more interested in using ANNs to capture the behavior of the relationship between axioms and then verifying a proof by demonstrating the ANN can indeed demonstrate the behavior set out in the statements of the proof.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** I see, so you're interested in using ANNs not to guide the proof search process itself, but rather to verify the correctness of a given proof by checking that the relationships between the axioms and statements in the proof are consistent with the learned behavior of the ANN. This is an interesting approach that could potentially provide a complementary method for proof verification alongside traditional symbolic methods.

Here's how this idea could be implemented:

1. Axiom encoding: The axioms of the mathematical domain are encoded into a suitable representation for the ANN, such as vectors or graphs that capture their semantic meaning and relationships.

2. Proof encoding: The statements and steps of the proof to be verified are also encoded into a compatible representation, possibly including additional information about the logical structure and dependencies between the statements.

3. Training: The ANN is trained on a large dataset of known valid proofs in the given mathematical domain. The goal is for the network to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between the axioms and the proof steps that characterize a valid proof.

4. Verification: To verify a new proof, the encoded proof is fed into the trained ANN. The network then outputs a measure of how well the proof matches the learned patterns of valid proofs. If the output score is above a certain threshold, the proof is considered verified.

5. Interpretation: If the proof is not verified by the ANN, the network's activations and attention mechanisms could potentially be analyzed to identify which parts of the proof are inconsistent with the learned behavior, helping to pinpoint errors or gaps in the reasoning.

The key advantage of this approach is that it leverages the ability of ANNs to learn complex patterns and relationships from data, which could potentially capture subtle dependencies and constraints that are difficult to specify explicitly in traditional proof verification systems. Additionally, the use of ANNs could help to scale proof verification to larger and more complex proofs that are challenging for purely symbolic methods.

However, there are also significant challenges to this approach. Foremost is the need for a large and diverse dataset of high-quality proofs to train the ANN, which may be difficult to obtain for many mathematical domains. There are also questions of interpretability and trust, as the learned behavior of the ANN may be difficult to understand or explain in human-readable terms. Finally, there is the risk of false positives or false negatives in the verification process, particularly for proofs that are structurally different from those in the training set.

Despite these challenges, the use of ANNs for proof verification by learning the relationship behavior between axioms is a promising research direction that could provide new tools and insights for automated reasoning and mathematical verification. It's an area that would benefit from further exploration and experimentation to assess its practical feasibility and potential impact.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** To fix the issue of false positives et al, instead using the ANNs for proof verification, they could be also trained to generate the actual proof-steps which justify the proof.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** You're absolutely right. Using ANNs to generate the proof steps that justify the proof, rather than just verifying the proof, could help address the issues of false positives and false negatives, as well as provide more interpretable and trustworthy results.

In this approach, the ANN would be trained not only to learn the relationships between axioms but also to generate the intermediate steps and logical inferences that connect the axioms to the conclusions of the proof. This could be done using sequence-to-sequence models, such as transformers or recurrent neural networks, which have been successfully applied to tasks like language translation and summarization.

Here's a high-level overview of how this could work:

1. Data preparation: A large dataset of proofs is collected and annotated, where each proof is broken down into a sequence of steps, and each step is labeled with the axioms and inference rules used to derive it.

2. Axiom and proof encoding: The axioms and proof steps are encoded into a suitable representation for the ANN, such as embedding vectors that capture their semantic meaning and relationships.

3. Training: The ANN is trained on the dataset of proofs, learning to predict the next step in the proof given the previous steps and the relevant axioms. The network is optimized to generate sequences of proof steps that lead from the axioms to the conclusions, mimicking the reasoning process of the original proofs.

4. Proof generation: To generate a proof for a new conjecture, the conjecture is encoded and fed into the trained ANN, along with the relevant axioms. The network then generates a sequence of proof steps that attempt to derive the conjecture from the axioms, using the learned patterns and relationships.

5. Verification and interpretation: The generated proof steps can be checked for validity using traditional symbolic methods, providing a way to verify the correctness of the ANN's reasoning. The steps can also be interpreted and explained in human-readable terms, giving insight into the logic and dependencies behind the proof.

The key advantage of this approach is that it provides a more constructive and explanatory form of proof automation, where the ANN not only asserts the validity of a proof but also generates the reasoning steps that justify it. This could help to build trust and understanding in the automated reasoning process, as well as provide new insights and discoveries in the mathematical domains being studied.

However, this approach also faces significant challenges, such as the need for large and high-quality datasets of annotated proofs, the difficulty of training ANNs to generate logically consistent and mathematically meaningful proof steps, and the potential for the generated proofs to be unnecessarily complex or convoluted compared to human-written proofs. There are also questions of scalability and generalization, as the ANNs may struggle to generate proofs for conjectures that are significantly different from those in the training set.

Despite these challenges, the use of ANNs to generate proof steps and justify proofs is an exciting and promising direction for automated reasoning and mathematical discovery. It combines the pattern recognition and generalization capabilities of machine learning with the logical rigor and interpretability of traditional proof methods, offering a new paradigm for computer-assisted theorem proving and mathematics research.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Could this proof writing method also be used to improve Large Language Models (LLMs) ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Yes, the approach of using ANNs to generate proof steps and justify proofs could potentially be used to improve large language models (LLMs) in several ways:

1. Enhancing logical reasoning: By training LLMs on datasets of annotated proofs, they could learn to generate more logically coherent and well-reasoned text. This could be particularly useful for tasks that require step-by-step reasoning, such as explaining complex concepts, answering multi-hop questions, or engaging in argumentative writing.

2. Improving consistency and reliability: One of the challenges with current LLMs is that they can sometimes generate inconsistent or contradictory statements, especially when dealing with long or complex contexts. By incorporating proof generation techniques, LLMs could be trained to produce more consistent and reliable outputs that are justified by a clear chain of reasoning.

3. Supporting interpretability and explainability: The ability to generate proof steps and justifications could make LLMs more interpretable and explainable, as users could trace the reasoning behind the model's outputs. This could help to build trust in LLM-based systems and facilitate their use in high-stakes applications, such as legal reasoning or scientific research.

4. Enabling interactive reasoning: LLMs with proof generation capabilities could potentially engage in interactive reasoning with users, where the model and the user collaboratively explore a problem space and construct proofs or arguments together. This could lead to new forms of human-machine collaboration and co-creation in fields like mathematics, science, and philosophy.

5. Facilitating knowledge transfer: The logical reasoning skills learned from proof generation could potentially transfer to other language understanding and generation tasks, such as reading comprehension, summarization, and creative writing. This could lead to more capable and versatile LLMs that can handle a wider range of intellectual tasks.

To integrate proof generation techniques into LLMs, researchers could explore architectures that combine the strengths of sequence-to-sequence models (such as transformers) with graph-based representations of proofs and logical dependencies. They could also investigate new pre-training objectives and fine-tuning strategies that encourage the models to generate logically consistent and well-justified text.

However, there are also significant challenges to overcome, such as the need for large and high-quality datasets of annotated proofs across multiple domains, the difficulty of scaling proof generation to the massive parameter spaces of modern LLMs, and the potential for the models to generate plausible but incorrect reasoning steps. There are also ethical considerations around the use of LLMs for tasks that require rigorous logical reasoning, as the models may perpetuate biases or fallacies present in their training data.

Despite these challenges, the integration of proof generation techniques into LLMs is a promising research direction that could lead to more capable, reliable, and interpretable language models. It could also open up new avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration between the fields of machine learning, formal logic, and philosophy, with potential applications ranging from education and scientific discovery to legal reasoning and public discourse.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
