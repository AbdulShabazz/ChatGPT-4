It is likely that some bonus content will be lost as people switch to all-digital streaming. This is because studios may not see the value in creating and storing bonus content if there is less demand for physical media. However, it is also possible that some studios will continue to create bonus content, even if it is only available for digital purchase.

Here are some of the factors that will affect the future of bonus content on movie disks:

* **The continued growth of streaming services:** As more and more people switch to streaming services, there will be less demand for physical media. This will make it less profitable for studios to create and store bonus content, as they will have a smaller audience for it.
* **The increasing cost of storage:** The cost of storing digital content is decreasing, but it is still significant. Studios will need to weigh the cost of storing bonus content against the potential revenue from selling it.
* **The demand for bonus content:** Some people still value bonus content, and they may be willing to pay extra for it. Studios may continue to create bonus content for these consumers, even if it is only available for digital purchase.

Ultimately, the future of bonus content on movie disks is uncertain. It is possible that bonus content will become less common or even disappear altogether. However, it is also possible that studios will find new ways to create and distribute bonus content that is appealing to consumers in the digital age.

Here are some possible ways that studios could preserve and distribute bonus content in the future:

* **Create exclusive bonus content for digital platforms:** Studios could create bonus content that is only available to people who purchase the movie digitally. This would give consumers an incentive to buy the movie digitally instead of streaming it.
* **Release bonus content as separate digital purchases:** Studios could release bonus content as separate digital purchases. This would allow consumers to choose which bonus content they want to purchase.
* **Partner with streaming services to offer bonus content:** Studios could partner with streaming services to offer bonus content as an add-on or bonus feature. This would allow consumers to access bonus content without having to purchase the movie.

It will be interesting to see how studios adapt to the changing landscape of home entertainment. It is possible that bonus content will become a thing of the past, but it is also possible that studios will find new and innovative ways to create and distribute bonus content that is appealing to consumers in the digital age.
