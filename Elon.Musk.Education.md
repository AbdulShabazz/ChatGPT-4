**Q:** What is Elon Musk's educational background ?

**A:** Elon Musk's educational background is both extensive and diverse, reflecting his deep interest in science, technology, and business from an early age.

### Early Education
Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1971. He attended several schools in South Africa, including Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and Pretoria Boys High School, from which he graduated. During his early years, Musk developed a keen interest in computing and technology, teaching himself programming and creating a video game called "Blastar" at the age of 12, which he sold for $500[1][2].

### Higher Education
At the age of 17, Musk moved to Canada to avoid mandatory military service in South Africa and to seek better opportunities. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria while waiting for his Canadian passport to be processed[2][4].

#### Queen's University
In 1989, Musk enrolled at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He spent two years there, during which he met Justine Wilson, who would later become his first wife[1][2].

#### University of Pennsylvania
In 1992, Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he pursued and completed two bachelor's degrees:
- **Bachelor of Science in Physics** from the College of Arts and Sciences
- **Bachelor of Arts in Economics** from the Wharton School of Business

Musk graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1997. His education in physics provided him with a strong analytical framework, which he has often cited as crucial for his problem-solving approach in his various ventures[1][2][3].

### Brief Stint at Stanford University
After completing his undergraduate degrees, Musk moved to California to pursue a Ph.D. in applied physics and materials science at Stanford University. However, he left the program after just two days to take advantage of the burgeoning opportunities in the internet boom. This decision led to the founding of his first company, Zip2, with his brother Kimbal Musk[2][4][5].

### Summary
Elon Musk's educational journey is marked by a strong foundation in both the sciences and economics, which has significantly influenced his career as an entrepreneur and innovator. His brief time at Stanford University, although short-lived, underscores his preference for practical application over academic pursuit, a theme that has been consistent throughout his career.

Musk's educational background has undoubtedly played a pivotal role in shaping his approach to business and technology, enabling him to tackle complex problems in fields ranging from space exploration to electric vehicles and beyond.
