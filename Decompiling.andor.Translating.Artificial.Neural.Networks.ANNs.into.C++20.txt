As of my last update in April 2023, there were no specific C++20 algorithms designed exclusively for decompiling artificial neural networks (ANNs) or other compact mathematical models into intelligible software. However, let me provide you with a detailed overview of the relevant concepts and tools that are typically involved in the process of understanding and interpreting ANNs:

1. **Decompilation vs. Interpretation of ANNs:**
   - **Decompilation** generally refers to the process of translating low-level code (like bytecode or machine code) back into a high-level language like C++.
   - In the context of ANNs, what's often sought is not decompilation in the strict sense but rather **interpretation** or **explanation** of the network's decision-making process.

2. **Interpretability and Explainability Tools:**
   - **Visualization Tools**: Libraries like TensorFlow's TensorBoard or tools like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can help visualize what features the network is focusing on.
   - **Attention Mechanisms**: In deep learning, attention mechanisms can be used to highlight parts of the input data most relevant for predictions, aiding in interpretability.

3. **Algorithmic Approaches:**
   - **Model Simplification**: Simplifying a complex model to a more interpretable form, like decision trees.
   - **Feature Importance Analysis**: Tools that rank the importance of input features in the modelâ€™s predictions.

4. **C++20 and Machine Learning:**
   - **C++ Libraries**: While C++20 itself does not have built-in features for ANNs interpretation, several C++ libraries (like Dlib, mlpack) can be used for machine learning tasks. These libraries, however, focus more on building and training models rather than interpreting them.
   - **Interfacing with Python**: Many C++ projects interface with Python for using machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which have more developed ecosystems for model interpretation.

5. **Challenges in Decompiling ANNs:**
   - **Complexity**: ANNs, especially deep learning models, are inherently complex and not easily translated into simple, human-readable formats.
   - **Loss of Information**: Decomposing ANNs into traditional software constructs often leads to loss of nuance and fidelity.

6. **Emerging Research:**
   - The field of AI interpretability is actively evolving. Research is ongoing to develop better tools and techniques to make AI decisions more transparent and understandable.

7. **Application in Software Engineering:**
   - **Hybrid Approaches**: In practice, a combination of traditional software engineering and machine learning is often used, where critical decisions are handled by understandable algorithms, and ANNs are used for augmenting these decisions.

In summary, while there are no specific C++20 algorithms for decompiling ANNs into intelligible software, a combination of interpretability tools, algorithmic approaches, and hybrid software engineering practices is used to understand and interpret these complex models. The field is rapidly evolving, and future developments may offer more direct methods for this task.
