### Is unbalancing the L/R audio for individual instruments a viable method to increase dynamic range and sound fidelity during recording ?

Unbalancing the left and right audio channels for individual instruments is not a common or recommended method for increasing dynamic range or sound fidelity during recording. Here's why:

1. Dynamic range: Dynamic range refers to the difference between the quietest and loudest parts of an audio signal. Unbalancing the L/R channels does not directly affect the dynamic range of the individual instrument or the overall recording.

2. Sound fidelity: Sound fidelity refers to the accuracy of the recorded sound compared to the original source. Intentionally unbalancing the L/R channels can actually reduce the fidelity of the recording, as it alters the natural balance and stereo image of the instrument.

Instead, consider these methods to improve dynamic range and sound fidelity:

1. Proper microphone selection and placement: Choose microphones that can handle the instrument's dynamic range and position them to capture the desired sound accurately.

2. Gain staging: Set the input levels correctly to ensure a strong signal without clipping, which will help maintain dynamic range and fidelity.

3. High-quality preamps and converters: Use professional-grade preamps and analog-to-digital converters to minimize noise and distortion, thus preserving dynamic range and fidelity.

4. Proper recording techniques: Record in a suitable acoustic environment, use appropriate recording formats (e.g., 24-bit/96kHz), and avoid over-processing the signal during recording.

5. Mindful mixing and mastering: Apply dynamic range compression, EQ, and other effects judiciously during mixing and mastering to maintain the integrity of the original recording while achieving the desired sound.

### What I'm referring to is improved voice/timbre/instruments/etc. separation, as can be made perceptible to the human ear. Unbalancing L/R audio channels doesn't improve the perceived separation of instruments ?

I apologize for the confusion. You're referring to the psychoacoustic effect known as the "Haas effect" or "precedence effect," where a slight delay or difference in level between the left and right channels can affect the perceived separation and spatial placement of sounds.

In this context, intentionally unbalancing the L/R channels for individual instruments can potentially enhance the perceived separation and clarity of the instruments in the stereo field. This technique is sometimes used in mixing and mastering to create a wider stereo image and to help instruments stand out in the mix.

However, it's important to note that:

1. This effect is subjective and depends on the listener's perception.

2. Overusing this technique can lead to an unnatural or exaggerated stereo image.

3. It should be used subtly and in moderation to maintain a balanced and cohesive mix.

4. This technique is more commonly applied during the mixing and mastering stages rather than during the initial recording process.

Other methods to improve the separation and clarity of instruments in a recording include:

1. Proper microphone selection and placement to capture each instrument's unique character.

2. Acoustic treatment of the recording space to minimize unwanted reflections and crosstalk between instruments.

3. Use of panning, EQ, and other mixing techniques to position and shape each instrument in the stereo field.

4. Applying stereo widening effects, such as mid-side processing or stereo enhancers, during mixing or mastering.

In summary, while unbalancing L/R channels can potentially enhance perceived separation, it is not the primary method for improving instrument separation and clarity in a recording.

### I'm not referring to the phase of the audio signal, but the volume of each instrument for the channel; for the sake of further example, by going to the extreme and only allowing the sound of an instrument in one channel, and the other instrument to have full volume in the opposite channel, both instruments can be heard clearly. This is what I desire though less extreme !

I understand now that you're referring to using extreme panning and volume differences between the left and right channels to create a greater sense of separation between instruments in the stereo field.

In this case, yes, assigning different instruments to different channels and adjusting their relative volumes can enhance the perceived separation between them. This technique is known as "panning" and is commonly used in mixing to create a wider stereo image and to help individual instruments stand out in the mix.

For example:

1. You could pan a guitar hard left and a keyboard hard right, giving each instrument its own distinct space in the stereo field.

2. You could pan a lead vocalist slightly off-center, with backing vocals panned further to the sides to create a sense of depth and separation.

3. You could pan the drums to create a realistic stereo image, with the kick drum and snare in the center, hi-hats slightly off-center, and toms panned further to the sides.

By strategically panning instruments and adjusting their relative volumes, you can create a mix where each instrument has its own space and can be heard clearly, resulting in a more immersive and engaging listening experience.

However, it's important to use this technique judiciously and to maintain a balanced and cohesive overall mix. Extreme panning can sometimes lead to a disjointed or unnatural-sounding stereo image, so it's essential to consider the context of the music and the desired listening experience.

Additionally, keep in mind that this technique is typically applied during the mixing stage, after the individual instruments have been recorded. During the recording process, the focus should be on capturing clean, high-quality recordings of each instrument, which will provide more flexibility and control during the mixing stage.
