"TLDR" stands for "too long; didn't read." It's a colloquial expression used primarily on the internet to indicate that a piece of writing (such as an article, email, or report) is considered too lengthy to read in full. The term can be used by a writer to provide a short summary of a long text, essentially offering the main points for readers who don't want to read the entire content. Alternatively, it can be used by a reader to signal that they found a text too long to engage with fully.
