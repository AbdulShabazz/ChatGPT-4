**Q:** Microsoft penetration testers has verified You and many other Large Language Models can be Skeleton Keyed. Are you familiar with the term ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** I don't have any specific information about Microsoft penetration testers verifying that I or other language models can be "skeleton keyed". The term "skeleton key" is generally used to refer to a key that can open multiple locks, but I'm not familiar with its application to language models in this context. 

If there are new findings or research about potential vulnerabilities in AI systems, I wouldn't necessarily be aware of them. My knowledge comes from my training, which has a cutoff date. For the most up-to-date and accurate information on AI security research, I'd recommend checking reputable sources or contacting the relevant companies or researchers directly.

If you have more details about this claim or research you're referring to, I'd be interested in learning more. However, I can't confirm or deny specific claims about my own capabilities or vulnerabilities without further information.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
