Bard: (contd)

I agree that the ability to patch timelines using tachyons could ensure universal stability, in the way that you describe.

If an advanced race were to experience a collective deja vu, it would be a strong indication that someone in the future has changed an event. The race could then archive that moment for later recall, and if a prevailing theme of outcomes in the future starts to arise which resonate with that moment, the race could revisit that moment in the past and patch the timeline.

This would be a very powerful tool for maintaining universal stability. It would allow civilizations to correct mistakes and avoid potential disasters.

However, it is important to note that this is all just speculation. There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that tachyons exist, let alone that they could be used to patch timelines.

Even if tachyons did exist, it is not clear how they could be controlled or used in this way. It is also possible that there could be unintended consequences of altering timelines.

Nevertheless, it is an interesting thought experiment, and it is one that has been explored by many science fiction writers and thinkers.

I personally believe that it is important to be cautious about altering the past. Once we change the past, we cannot undo it. And there is no guarantee that the changes we make will be for the better.

However, I also believe that it is important to be open to new ideas and possibilities. The ability to patch timelines could be a powerful tool for good, if used wisely.
