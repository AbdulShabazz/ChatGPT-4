**Q:** Are OLED micro lens arrays and micro OLEDs the same technology ?

**A:** No, OLED micro lens arrays and micro OLEDs are related but distinct technologies.

Micro OLEDs (also known as ÂµOLEDs or mOLEDs) are very tiny OLED displays, typically less than 1 inch in diagonal size. They are self-emissive displays made up of an array of microscopic OLED pixels. Micro OLEDs are used in applications requiring very small, high resolution displays such as viewfinders, head-mounted displays, and projectors.

OLED micro lens arrays, on the other hand, refer to arrays of microscopic lenses placed over an OLED panel or substrate. The purpose is to enhance the light extraction and directional emission from the OLEDs. Each micro lens focuses the light from the OLED pixel underneath it, increasing the brightness and efficiency. Micro lens arrays can be applied to both regular size and micro OLED displays.

So in summary, micro OLEDs are a type of miniaturized OLED display, while OLED micro lens arrays are an optical enhancement that can be applied to various sizes of OLED displays, including micro OLEDs, to improve their optical performance. The two technologies are complementary but serve different purposes in OLED display systems.
