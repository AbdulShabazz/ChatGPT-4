Yes, it's definitely possible for an array of dynamic drivers to emulate a larger cone. Here's why and how:

**Basic Principle:**

The main goal of a larger cone is to move more air, increasing sound pressure levels (volume) and improving low-frequency reproduction (bass). An array of smaller drivers can achieve a similar effect by working together:

* **Increased Surface Area:** Multiple smaller cones together have a larger combined surface area than a single larger cone. This translates to more air being displaced, mimicking the volume potential of the larger cone.
* **Distributed Power:** With an array, the power from the amplifier is distributed across several drivers. This means each driver has less work to do individually, which can reduce distortion and improve overall clarity.

**How It's Done:**

* **Line Arrays:**  A common implementation is a line array, where multiple identical drivers are stacked vertically. This arrangement focuses the sound in a specific direction while providing the air-moving displacement benefits of a larger driver.
* **Subwoofer Arrays:** For bass frequencies specifically, multiple subwoofer drivers can be configured in an array. These arrays often rely on careful placement and timing adjustments between the drivers to maximize bass output and control its directivity.

**Advantages:**

* **Scalability:** Arrays offer more flexibility. You can increase the effective cone size by adding more drivers to the array.
* **Directivity Control**: Through phasing and positioning, arrays can be used to tailor the sound dispersion pattern, reducing unwanted reflections and creating a more focused sound field. 
* **Reduced Distortion:** Spreading the power load across multiple drivers can result in reduced distortion compared to a single large driver working under heavy strain.

**Challenges:**

* **Cost:** Arrays naturally require more individual drivers, potentially increasing costs.
* **Complexity:**  Configuration and equalization of arrays can be complex, especially for optimal bass response from  subwoofer arrays.
* **Potential Interference:** Incorrect phasing or spacing can lead to interference patterns and uneven sound.

**Overall, while there are complexities, the concept of using an array of dynamic drivers to emulate a larger cone is very sound and widely used in speaker systems, especially for live sound and large-scale installations.**
