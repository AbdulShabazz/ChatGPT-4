**Q:** Can i winterize with low viscosity and summerize with high viscosity oil, annually ?

**A:** Yes, you can winterize your vehicle with low viscosity oil and summerize it with high viscosity oil annually, depending on your climate and driving conditions. This practice can optimize engine performance and protection based on seasonal temperature variations. Here's how and why you might do this:

### **Winterization with Low Viscosity Oil**

- **Low Viscosity Oil in Winter (e.g., 5W-30 or 0W-20)**:
  - **Cold Weather Benefits**: Low viscosity oils flow more easily at lower temperatures, ensuring quicker circulation throughout the engine during cold starts. This reduces the wear that can occur when the engine is cold and parts are not yet fully lubricated.
  - **Easier Starts**: The reduced thickness of the oil in colder temperatures allows the engine to start more easily, reducing strain on the battery and starter motor.
  - **Fuel Efficiency**: In cold weather, lower viscosity oil can contribute to better fuel efficiency, as it requires less energy to pump through the engine.

### **Summerization with High Viscosity Oil**

- **High Viscosity Oil in Summer (e.g., 10W-40 or 20W-50)**:
  - **High Temperature Protection**: During hot weather, engines can reach higher operating temperatures, and a thicker oil provides a more robust film between moving parts, helping to prevent metal-on-metal contact and reduce wear.
  - **Oil Stability**: High viscosity oil is less likely to thin out excessively at elevated temperatures, maintaining effective lubrication and protecting the engine from potential overheating or oil breakdown.
  - **Older Engines**: For older engines, using higher viscosity oil in the summer can help maintain proper oil pressure and reduce the likelihood of oil leaks due to worn seals.

### **Considerations and Recommendations**

- **Climate Suitability**: This practice is most beneficial in regions with significant temperature variations between seasons. In areas with mild climates, the benefits might be less pronounced, and using a multi-grade oil suitable for year-round use could be more convenient.
  
- **Engine Type and Condition**: Always consider your engine’s specific requirements and manufacturer recommendations. Some modern engines are designed to run on lower viscosity oils year-round, even in warmer climates.

- **Oil Change Frequency**: If you choose to switch oils seasonally, ensure you’re adhering to appropriate oil change intervals. Changing oil twice a year (before winter and summer) might also be a good time to conduct other seasonal maintenance checks.

- **Synthetic vs. Conventional Oil**: Synthetic oils generally offer better performance across a broader range of temperatures, so if you use synthetic oil, you might find that a single oil grade suffices for both winter and summer. However, switching between different viscosity grades is still an option if you want to optimize for extreme conditions.

### **Conclusion**

Switching between low viscosity oil for winter and high viscosity oil for summer is a viable strategy to ensure optimal engine protection and performance year-round. Just be sure to align your choices with your vehicle's specifications and the climate in which you drive. This approach can help reduce wear during cold starts in the winter and provide better protection under the high heat of summer.
