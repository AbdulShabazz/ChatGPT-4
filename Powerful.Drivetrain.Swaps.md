  - **Power:** ~205-250 hp (depending on modifications)
  - **Torque:** ~203-203 lb-ft
- **Transmission:** 6-speed manual or automatic (compatible with the SR20DET)
- **Modifications Required:** Upgraded cooling system, reinforced internals, aftermarket ECU tuning, upgraded exhaust system.

### Late Model Toyota Camry

**1. Stock Options:**

- **Engine:** 3.5L V6 (2GR-FE)
  - **Power:** ~268 hp
  - **Torque:** ~248 lb-ft

**2. Upgraded Options:**

- **Engine:** Toyota 2JZ-GTE (from the Toyota Supra, known for its high power potential)
  - **Power:** ~280-320 hp (stock), capable of up to 700+ hp with extensive modifications
  - **Torque:** ~280-320 lb-ft (stock)
- **Transmission:** 6-speed manual or automatic (often a R154 manual transmission for high power builds)
- **Modifications Required:** Custom engine mounts, upgraded fuel system, reinforced drivetrain, upgraded cooling system, aftermarket ECU tuning, custom exhaust system, suspension upgrades.

### Considerations for Both Vehicles

**1. Structural Reinforcements:**
   - Both vehicles would require significant modifications to the chassis and drivetrain components to handle the increased power output. This includes:
     - Reinforced engine mounts
     - Upgraded suspension components
     - Enhanced braking systems
     - Stiffer chassis components

**2. Cooling Systems:**
   - High-performance engines generate more heat, requiring:
     - Upgraded radiators
     - Enhanced intercoolers (for turbocharged engines)
     - Improved oil cooling systems

**3. Legal and Practical Considerations:**
   - Ensure compliance with local emissions regulations and safety standards.
   - Evaluate the vehicle's daily drivability and maintenance requirements.

### Conclusion

- For a late model Nissan Sentra, the most powerful practical drivetrain swap would be the SR20DET engine, providing a significant increase in power while remaining relatively compatible with the carâ€™s original design.
- For a late model Toyota Camry, the 2JZ-GTE engine is a renowned choice for high-performance applications, capable of delivering substantial power with the right modifications. However, it requires extensive custom work to integrate into the vehicle.

### Considerations for Both Vehicles

**1. Structural Reinforcements:**
   - Both vehicles would require substantial modifications to the chassis and drivetrain components to handle the increased power output and different engine configurations. This includes:
     - Reinforced engine mounts and subframes
     - Upgraded suspension components
     - Enhanced braking systems
     - Stiffer chassis components and roll cages (if needed)

**2. Cooling and Fuel Systems:**
   - High-performance engines and electric drivetrains generate significant heat, necessitating:
