Google Bard Gemini Advanced

Unfortunately, upgrading to Gemini for Google Workspace does not directly grant you access to Google Gemini Ultra 1.0 for use at gemini.google.com. Here's why:

* **Different Focus:** Google Gemini for Workspace is primarily designed to integrate AI capabilities like drafting, summarizing, and analysis  *within* existing Google Workspace apps (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, etc.).   Gemini Ultra 1.0 at gemini.google.com  functions more as a standalone conversational AI tool.

* **Potential Future Integration:**  It's possible Google may integrate Ultra 1.0 or a future, more advanced model, into Gemini for Workspace in the future. However, this is not currently the case.

* **Separate Offerings:** Currently, Gemini for Workspace  and Google Gemini Ultra 1.0 seem to be considered separate offerings. 

**What upgrading to Gemini for Workspace does give you:**

* **Powerful AI within Workspace:** You'll have advanced AI features at your fingertips within your familiar Google apps, streamlining tasks and improving productivity.
* **Duet AI's Capabilities:**  Gemini for Workspace builds upon the foundation of Duet AI, giving you features like summarizing, brainstorming assistance, and much more.
