Q:Provide a delicious eggnog recipe.

A:Certainly, here is a delicious eggnog recipe that you can try:

Ingredients:

    4 cups whole milk
    1 1/2 cups heavy cream
    1 cup granulated sugar
    6 large egg yolks
    2 tsp vanilla extract
    1 tsp ground cinnamon
    1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
    1/4 tsp salt
    3/4 cup rum (optional)
    Whipped cream, for topping
    Ground cinnamon or nutmeg, for garnish

Instructions:

    In a medium-sized saucepan, whisk together the milk, heavy cream, and 1/2 cup of sugar. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture comes to a simmer.

    In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and remaining 1/2 cup of sugar until the mixture is light and frothy.

    Gradually whisk about a cup of the hot milk mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Then, slowly whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining milk mixture.

    Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5-7 minutes.

    Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and rum (if using).

    Chill the eggnog in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or until it is completely cold.

    To serve, pour the chilled eggnog into glasses and top with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of ground cinnamon or nutmeg.

Enjoy your delicious homemade eggnog!

    1 pound elbow macaroni
    4 tablespoons unsalted butter
    1/4 cup all-purpose flour
    3 cups whole milk
    1/2 cup heavy cream
    1/2 teaspoon salt
    1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
    1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
    1/4 teaspoon black pepper
