While there's no official statement from Epic Games on the exact reason behind the absence of named reroutes in Blueprints, there are several potential technical and practical considerations that might explain their lack of implementation:

**Technical complexities:**

* **Different nature of data:** Blueprint nodes handle various data types, including objects, actors, and arrays, while material nodes primarily deal with numerical values and vectors. Implementing named reroutes for such diverse data types might require complex technical solutions.
* **Performance impact:** Adding named reroutes could potentially impact the performance of Blueprints, especially for complex graphs with numerous nodes. This is because the engine would need to track and manage additional connections and data flow information.
* **Graph navigation and debugging:** Named reroutes in blueprints could potentially complicate graph navigation and debugging. Visualizing and understanding the flow of data within intricate blueprint graphs could become more challenging with extra named connections.

**Practical considerations:**

* **Limited use case:** Compared to materials, where named reroutes enhance organization and readability, the potential benefit of named reroutes in Blueprints might be less significant. Many blueprint graphs are relatively simple and don't require extensive connection naming.
* **Alternative solutions:** Efficient and robust alternatives for organizing and managing data flow within Blueprints already exist, like using functions, macros, and event dispatchers. Introducing named reroutes might not offer a substantial enough advantage to justify the potential technical complexities.
* **Future development focus:** Epic Games might be focusing their development resources on addressing other priorities within the Unreal Engine, potentially delaying or even abandoning the implementation of named reroutes for Blueprints.

It's important to note that this is just speculation based on technical and practical considerations. Without an official statement from Epic Games, the exact reason for the absence of named reroutes in Blueprints remains unclear.
