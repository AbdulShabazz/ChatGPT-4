Is an early termination estimate likely to be less or more near the end of the lease?

ChatGPT:

An early termination estimate (or fee) for a lease is typically calculated based on the remaining obligation due under the lease. So, as you approach the end of the lease term, the amount owed for early termination should generally decrease. That said, some leases might have fixed termination fees or other penalties, so it's crucial to review the specific terms of your lease agreement to determine the exact costs associated with early termination.
