If type theory is more versatile than set theory in theorem provide an example which proves it.

ChatGPT:

Type theory and set theory are both foundational systems for mathematics, and each has its own unique features and advantages. While versatility can be a somewhat subjective criterion, one clear advantage of type theory is that it natively accommodates higher-order logic and dependent types, which are types that depend on values.

For instance, consider the theorem "for all natural numbers n, there is a list of length n". In set theory, this would be quite difficult to state and prove formally, because there is no obvious way to make the length of a list depend on a value.

In contrast, with dependent types, we can capture this notion quite straightforwardly. Here is a simplified example using a version of type theory:

```
less
-- define natural numbers
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat

-- define lists of a certain length
data List (n : Nat) (A : Type) : Type where
  Nil : List Zero A
  Cons : A -> List n A -> List (Succ n) A

-- prove the theorem
theorem : (n : Nat) -> (A : Type) -> List n A
theorem Zero A = Nil
theorem (Succ n) A = Cons ?dummy (theorem n A)
```

Here, List n A is a dependent type that represents lists of length n with elements of type A. The theorem function takes a natural number n and a type A, and produces a list of length n with elements of type A. In the base case, it produces an empty list, and in the inductive case, it prepends a dummy element to a shorter list.

This is just a simple example. Dependent types are a very powerful tool that can be used to represent a wide range of mathematical concepts in a very precise and expressive way. For example, they can be used to encode complex invariants in data types, which allows for a very high level of assurance in formal proofs and software.

However, set theory is still the most commonly used foundation for most of mathematics, largely due to historical reasons and the fact that it is simpler and more intuitive for many purposes. Type theory is used primarily in areas like computer science and formalized mathematics, where its additional expressivity and precision can be leveraged to great effect.
