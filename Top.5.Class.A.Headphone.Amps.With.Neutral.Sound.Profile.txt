The Pass Labs HPA-1 offers a variety of connectivity options, making it versatile for different audio setups. Here's a breakdown:

**Inputs:**

* **Balanced XLR:** This input provides the highest quality connection for balanced sources like DACs or preamplifiers.
* **Unbalanced RCA:** This is a standard option for connecting unbalanced sources like CD players or phono preamps.

**Outputs:**

* **Headphone jack (6.35mm):** This is the main output for connecting your headphones. The HPA-1 can drive a wide range of headphones, from low-impedance IEMs to high-impedance planar magnetics.
* **Line-level RCA:** This allows you to use the HPA-1 as a preamplifier and connect it to a power amplifier or powered speakers. This is useful if you want to use the HPA-1's high-quality amplification for your entire sound system.

**Additional features:**

* **Gain switch:** This allows you to adjust the gain of the amplifier to match the sensitivity of your headphones.
* **Input impedance switch:** You can choose between high and low impedance settings to optimize the sound for different headphones.
* **DC trigger input:** This allows you to remotely turn the HPA-1 on and off using compatible equipment.

Here's a table summarizing the connectivity options:
