The League of Nations and the United Nations were both established with the primary goal of maintaining international peace and security, but they differ significantly in their structure, functions, and effectiveness. Here's a comparison based on various aspects:

### 1. Foundation and Historical Context

- **League of Nations:** Founded after World War I, the League of Nations was established under the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Its creation was largely attributed to the ideas of then U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, although the United States never joined the League. The organization aimed to prevent another devastating war through collective security and disarmament and to settle international disputes through negotiation and arbitration.

- **United Nations:** Formed in the aftermath of World War II, the United Nations was established in 1945 to avoid the failures of the League of Nations. The UN was created to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, and promote social progress, better living standards, and human rights.

### 2. Membership

- **League of Nations:** Initially had 42 founding members, with a peak membership of 58 states. However, significant powers like the United States never joined, and others like Germany and the Soviet Union were members only part of the time.

- **United Nations:** Started with 51 member countries; now has 193 member states, making it a more universally recognized and inclusive body.

### 3. Structure

- **League of Nations:** Its main organs were the Assembly (where each member country had one vote), the Council (a smaller group with permanent and non-permanent members meant for executive decisions), and the Permanent Secretariat. It also included various committees and commissions.

- **United Nations:** Has a more complex structure, including the General Assembly (where all members have equal representation), the Security Council (with five permanent members and ten non-permanent members elected for two-year terms), the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice, the UN Secretariat, and various programs and specialized agencies.

### 4. Powers and Effectiveness

- **League of Nations:** Lacked its own armed forces and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resolutions, sanctions, and decisions, which they often did not. Its effectiveness was undermined by the absence of major powers and its inability to prevent aggression by Axis powers in the 1930s.

- **United Nations:** Has the ability to undertake peacekeeping operations and impose sanctions through the Security Council. While it has faced criticisms for its effectiveness in preventing conflicts and enforcing decisions, the UN has played a significant role in peacekeeping, conflict resolution, and humanitarian aid.

### 5. Legacy and Impact

- **League of Nations:** Although it ultimately failed to prevent World War II, the League established a precedent for international cooperation and conflict resolution. Its failures highlighted the need for a stronger global organization, leading to the creation of the United Nations.

- **United Nations:** Despite its challenges, the UN has had a significant impact on international law, human rights, economic development, and humanitarian aid. It has been instrumental in decolonization processes, promoting democracy, and addressing global issues such as climate change, pandemics, and refugees.

In summary, while both organizations share similar goals, the United Nations represents a more evolved and comprehensive attempt at fostering international peace and cooperation, learning from the limitations and failures of the League of Nations.
