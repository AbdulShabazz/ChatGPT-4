Hello, this is Bing. I'm glad you are interested in text-to-speech synthesis. 

The pre-emphasis stage is a common preprocessing step for speech recognition, but it is not necessary for speech synthesis. In fact, some end-to-end speech synthesis models do not use any intermediate features such as mel-spectrograms, but directly generate raw audio waveforms from text or phonemes¹². These models use adversarial training and prediction losses to produce high-fidelity audio that matches the ground truth in terms of duration and spectral content¹².

However, if you want to use a two-stage speech synthesis pipeline that involves a feature generation model and a vocoder, you can still utilize the information from the pre-emphasis stage. One way to do that is to apply the inverse of the pre-emphasis filter to the generated mel-spectrograms before feeding them to the vocoder. This can help restore the natural spectral tilt of the speech signal and improve the quality of the synthesized audio³.

I hope this helps you understand the role of pre-emphasis in speech synthesis. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask me.
