A lead acid battery spill is a serious hazard that requires careful and immediate action. Here are some steps to follow to clean up a lead acid battery spill safely and effectively:

- Wear protective gloves, goggles, and a face mask to avoid contact with the corrosive acid and harmful fumes.
- Put the leaking battery in two garbage bags and seal them tightly. Dispose of the battery properly at a recycling center or a hazardous waste facility.
