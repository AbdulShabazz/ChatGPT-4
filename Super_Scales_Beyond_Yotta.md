The measurement scales beyond tera- (10^12), peta- (10^15), exa- (10^18), zetta- (10^21), and yotta- (10^24) are as follows:

1. Brontobyte: 10^27
2. Geopbyte: 10^30

These units are not officially part of the International System of Units (SI), but they are sometimes used in discussions about data storage and computing power. Beyond these, there aren't widely recognized or standardized prefixes for higher magnitudes.

The pronunciations for these units beyond the commonly used SI prefixes are as follows:

1. **Brontobyte**: Pronounced as "BRON-toh-bite"
2. **Geopbyte**: Pronounced as "GEE-op-bite"

These pronunciations follow standard English pronunciation rules, with the emphasis typically placed on the first syllable. Keep in mind that since these terms are not officially recognized in the SI system and are used less frequently, variations in pronunciation might occur.
