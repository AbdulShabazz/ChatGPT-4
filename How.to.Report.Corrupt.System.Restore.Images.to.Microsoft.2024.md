> **Title**: Request to Include System Image Corruption Checks in Microsoft Defender Scans
>
> **Description**: 
> I would like to suggest that Microsoft Defender includes checks for corrupt system images during its vulnerability scans. This feature would help ensure that system restore points and backup images are not compromised by malware, providing an additional layer of security and reliability for users. Currently, malware can corrupt these images, making system recovery difficult or impossible. Including this check in Microsoft Defender would greatly enhance the security and integrity of Windows systems.

> Thank you for considering this suggestion.

By following these steps, you can effectively communicate your request to Microsoft and potentially influence future updates to Microsoft Defender.
