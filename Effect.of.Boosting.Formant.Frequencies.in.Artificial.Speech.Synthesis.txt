Boosting the formant frequencies and suppressing the other frequencies in artificial speech synthesis can have a number of effects, both positive and negative.

On the positive side, boosting the formant frequencies can make artificial speech sound more intelligible and clearer. This is because the formant frequencies are the primary acoustic cues that humans use to perceive vowels. By boosting these frequencies, it is possible to make the vowel sounds more distinct and easier to identify.

In addition, boosting the formant frequencies can also make artificial speech sound more natural and human-like. This is because the formant frequencies are also important for conveying the tone and intonation of speech. By boosting these frequencies, it is possible to make the artificial speech sound more expressive and engaging.

However, there are also some potential negative effects to boosting the formant frequencies and suppressing the other frequencies in artificial speech synthesis. One potential problem is that it can make the artificial speech sound harsh and metallic. This is because the formant frequencies are also responsible for producing some of the higher-pitched frequencies in speech. By boosting these frequencies, it is possible to make the artificial speech sound too bright and harsh.

Another potential problem is that boosting the formant frequencies can make the artificial speech sound less intelligible in noisy environments. This is because the formant frequencies are more susceptible to being masked by noise than the lower-pitched frequencies. By boosting the formant frequencies, it is possible to make the artificial speech more difficult to hear in noisy environments.

Overall, the effects of boosting the formant frequencies and suppressing the other frequencies in artificial speech synthesis will vary depending on the specific implementation. However, it is important to be aware of the potential negative effects of this approach, such as harshness and reduced intelligibility in noisy environments.

Here are some tips for boosting the formant frequencies and suppressing the other frequencies in artificial speech synthesis in a way that minimizes the negative effects:

* Use a formant synthesis technique that allows for precise control over the formant frequencies. This will help to avoid boosting the formant frequencies too much, which can lead to harshness.
* Use a machine learning technique to train the speech synthesis system to produce more natural-sounding speech, even with boosted formant frequencies. This will help to reduce the negative effects of harshness and reduced intelligibility in noisy environments.
* Carefully test the speech synthesis system in a variety of environments, including noisy environments, to ensure that it is producing intelligible and natural-sounding speech.

By following these tips, it is possible to boost the formant frequencies and suppress the other frequencies in artificial speech synthesis in a way that improves the intelligibility and naturalness of the speech without introducing any negative effects.
