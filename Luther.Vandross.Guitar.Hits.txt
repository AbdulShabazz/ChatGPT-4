Are there any others by him opening with a signature guitar riff?

ChatGPT:

Luther Vandross is best known for his soulful ballads, but he has a number of songs that incorporate memorable guitar parts. While "Never Too Much" is the most iconic when it comes to an upbeat guitar riff, there are other songs in his discography that feature the guitar prominently. However, it's worth noting that not all of them start with a guitar riff.

If "Never Too Much" isn't the song you had in mind, I'd recommend exploring some of his other hits or albums. While he may not have many tracks that open specifically with a "signature" guitar riff, you might find the song you're thinking of by listening to some of his other popular tracks.
