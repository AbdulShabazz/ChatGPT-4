**Q:** If an Olympic Team gymnastics coach appeals a scoring difficulty decision and has the appeal overturned for being outside of the allotted 1 minutes appeals window, from which the score is posted, is there further recourse if the appeal missed the appeals windows by 4 seconds ?

**A:** In Olympic gymnastics, the appeal process for a scoring decision is strictly governed by time limits and procedures established by the FIG (Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique). According to the rules:

1. **Appeals Window**: Coaches have a precise window of 1 minute (60 seconds) from when the score is posted to submit an appeal concerning the difficulty score.

2. **Timing Compliance**: If an appeal is submitted even a few seconds outside of this 1-minute window, it is typically considered invalid. This strict timing rule is enforced to maintain fairness and the integrity of the competition.

3. **Overturning an Appeal**: If an appeal is overturned because it was submitted outside the allotted window (e.g., 4 seconds late), there is generally no further recourse. The decision to invalidate the appeal is final according to FIG rules.

4. **No Further Recourse**: The rules do not provide for any leniency or additional appeals if an appeal is late, even by a small margin such as 4 seconds. The timing is enforced uniformly to ensure that all teams are held to the same standard.

5. **Considerations**: Coaches are expected to be very vigilant about the timing of their appeals. In practice, appeals should ideally be prepared and submitted as quickly as possible within the allowed window to avoid any issues.

Given this strict protocol, if the appeal was indeed 4 seconds late, there would be no further recourse within the established rules of the competition.
