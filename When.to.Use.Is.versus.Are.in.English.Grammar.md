**Q:** When is it correct to use the third person present tense singular of Be, "is"; versus "are" ?

**A:** In English grammar, the choice between "is" and "are" depends on the subject of the sentence. 

Use "is" when the subject is:
1. A singular noun: The book is on the table.
2. A singular pronoun (he, she, it): He is a doctor.
3. A non-count noun: The furniture is expensive.
4. A gerund (verb + ing): Swimming is good exercise.

Use "are" when the subject is:
1. A plural noun: The books are on the table.
2. A plural pronoun (we, you, they): They are doctors.
3. A compound subject joined by "and": John and Mary are friends.
4. The pronoun "you," even if it refers to a single person: You are amazing.

Remember that collective nouns (e.g., team, family, group) can take either "is" or "are" depending on whether the group is considered as a single unit or as individuals:

- The team is ready for the game. (considered as a single unit)
- The team are discussing their strategy. (considered as individuals)

**Q:** Expound on why "are" is the correct use in the second example, because it seems intuitive to use "are" in both. Is there a convenient shorthand rule to determine which use is correct ?

**A:** In the second example, "The team are discussing their strategy," the verb "are" is used because the collective noun "team" is being considered as a group of individuals rather than a single unit. This is called notional agreement or notional concord, where the verb agrees with the notion of plurality rather than the grammatical form of the subject.

When using collective nouns, the choice between "is" and "are" often depends on whether you're considering the group as a single entity (use "is") or as a collection of individuals (use "are"). This distinction is more common in British English, while American English tends to favor using "is" with collective nouns.

A convenient shorthand rule to determine which use is correct:

1. If you can replace the collective noun with a singular pronoun (it) and the sentence still makes sense, use "is."
   - The team is ready for the game. → It is ready for the game.

2. If you can replace the collective noun with a plural pronoun (they) and the sentence still makes sense, use "are."
   - The team are discussing their strategy. → They are discussing their strategy.

However, this rule isn't always foolproof, and the choice between "is" and "are" can sometimes be a matter of context, emphasis, or personal preference. In general, if you want to emphasize the group as a unified whole, use "is," and if you want to emphasize the individuals within the group, use "are."

**Q:** Is the correct designation associated with the fact the direct object (the team) is a noun which acts as a container for other objects which are nouns of the same type that are either individually or collectively associated with the sentence modifier ?

**A:** Yes, you're on the right track. The choice between "is" and "are" with collective nouns often depends on whether the noun is being treated as a singular entity (a container) or as a collection of individual elements within that container.

When the collective noun is acting as a unified whole or a container, it is typically treated as a singular entity, and the singular verb "is" is used. In this case, the focus is on the group itself, not on the individual members.

However, when the sentence focuses on the individual elements within the collective noun, and their actions, thoughts, or attributes, the plural verb "are" is often used. This is because the emphasis shifts from the container to its contents, and the noun is treated as a collection of individuals.

In the sentence "The team are discussing their strategy," the focus is on the individual team members discussing among themselves, rather than the team as a single unit. The plural possessive pronoun "their" reinforces this notion of individuality within the group.

So, while the designation isn't directly related to the grammatical term "direct object," your understanding of the collective noun acting as a container for other nouns of the same type is a good way to think about when to use "is" or "are" in these situations.
