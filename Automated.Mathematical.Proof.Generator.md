Write a web page, consisting of two textarea elements, which uses an elegant javascript algorithm to return the following outputs for each input!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** I understand you'd like me to create a web page with two textarea elements and JavaScript code to implement an algorithm that processes mathematical proofs based on given axioms. I'll create an HTML file with the necessary structure and JavaScript to handle this functionality. Here's the code:

```html

This HTML file creates a web page with two textarea elements and a "Solve" button. The JavaScript code implements an algorithm to generate proofs based on the given axioms and proof statement.

Here's a brief explanation of how the code works:

1. The `solveProblem()` function is called when the "Solve" button is clicked.
2. It parses the input, extracting axioms and the proof statement.
3. The `generateProof()` function creates the proof by applying axioms to reduce the right-hand side and expand the left-hand side of the equation.
4. The `tryReduce()` and `tryExpand()` functions attempt to apply axioms to simplify or expand expressions.
5. The proof steps are collected and formatted into the output.

This implementation should handle the test cases you provided. However, please note that this is a simplified approach and may not work for all possible mathematical proofs. More complex proofs might require a more sophisticated algorithm.

Would you like me to explain any part of the code in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Indeed! What an elegant prover!! I made a small change to 'parseInput', 
/*
        function parseInput(input) {
            const lines = input.split('\n').map(line => line.trim()).filter(line => line && !line.startsWith('//'));
            const axioms = [];
            let proofStatement = '';
            const isProof = lines.length-1;
            lines
                .forEach((line, indexZ, thisArray) => {
                    if (indexZ != isProof) {
                        axioms.push(line);
                    } else {
                        proofStatement = line;
                    }        
                });
            return { axioms, proofStatement };
        }
*/​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Thank you for sharing your modification to the `parseInput` function. Your version is indeed more concise and eliminates the need for the 'Prove' keyword in the input. Let's break down the changes and discuss their implications:

```javascript
function parseInput(input) {
    const lines = input.split('\n').map(line => line.trim()).filter(line => line && !line.startsWith('//'));
    const axioms = [];
    let proofStatement = '';
    const isProof = lines.length - 1;
    lines.forEach((line, indexZ, thisArray) => {
        if (indexZ != isProof) {
            axioms.push(line);
        } else {
            proofStatement = line;
        }        
    });
    return { axioms, proofStatement };
}
```

Key changes and their effects:

1. Removal of the 'Prove' keyword check:
   - This simplifies the input format, assuming the last line is always the proof statement.
   - It's more flexible as it doesn't require a specific keyword to denote the proof statement.

2. Use of `forEach` with index:
   - This approach iterates through all lines once, which is efficient.
   - It uses the line's index to determine whether it's an axiom or the proof statement.

3. `const isProof = lines.length - 1`:
   - This elegantly identifies the last line as the proof statement.

4. Simplified logic:
   - The function now has a clearer structure: all lines except the last are axioms, and the last line is the proof statement.

These changes make the parsing more straightforward and less prone to errors from missing keywords. It also makes the input format more compact and user-friendly.

The modification is a good example of refactoring to improve code clarity and efficiency. It maintains the functionality while simplifying the implementation. This change would work well with the rest of the proof generation system we discussed earlier.

Would you like to discuss any other aspects of the code or make further improvements?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** You originally provided a very elegant solution. All of my earlier revisions were over 1100 lines, because perhaps I was over engineering the code - building helpers, and tokenizers, and parsers, and axiom dictionaries, etc. It all resulted in a significant hit to performance !! The core LHS/RHS tryrReduce and tryExpand logic was present, however I would like to learn how to contrive elegant solutions such as this.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Thank you for your kind words and for sharing your experience. It's a common challenge in programming to find the right balance between elegance, functionality, and performance. Your journey from a complex 1100+ line solution to appreciating a more concise approach is a valuable learning experience. Here are some tips to help you develop more elegant solutions:

1. Start simple: Begin with the core functionality and add complexity only when necessary.

2. Focus on the problem's essence: In this case, the essence was matching and replacing parts of expressions.

3. Use built-in language features: JavaScript's string and array methods are powerful and often sufficient for many tasks.

4. Avoid premature optimization: Build a working solution first, then optimize if needed.

5. Refactor iteratively: Continuously look for ways to simplify your code as you develop.

6. Learn from existing solutions: Studying elegant code, like the original solution, can provide insights into effective problem-solving approaches.

7. Practice problem decomposition: Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

8. Embrace functional programming concepts: They often lead to more concise and readable code.

9. Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Look for patterns you can abstract into reusable functions.

10. Prioritize readability: Clear, self-explanatory code is often more elegant than clever but obscure solutions.

11. Use appropriate data structures: Choosing the right data structure can significantly simplify your code.

12. Leverage language-specific idioms: Each programming language has its own set of idiomatic expressions that can make code more concise and efficient.

Remember, elegance in code often comes with experience and practice. Keep solving problems, studying good code, and refining your approach. The fact that you recognized the elegance in the simpler solution shows you're on the right path to developing this skill.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
