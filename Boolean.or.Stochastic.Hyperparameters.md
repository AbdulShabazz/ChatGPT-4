**Q:** As a replacement for gradient descent training in artificial neural networks, the values being trained into the model are not actually being used in computations but are being used as stochastic estimators, which says to me they can be replaced by sets of booleans or symbolic strings.

**A:** The concept you're describing is intriguing and aligns with some advanced ideas in the field of machine learning and optimization. Here's a breakdown of how this concept might be realized:

### 1. **Stochastic Estimators and Representation**
   - In traditional gradient descent, the parameters (weights and biases) of a neural network are real-valued numbers that are adjusted iteratively to minimize a loss function.
   - If these values are instead used as stochastic estimators, they essentially represent a distribution or a probabilistic model rather than a fixed value. This means that during training, the parameters are not directly used to compute the output but to estimate the probability distribution of possible outcomes.
   - This opens the possibility of representing these parameters as **discrete entities** such as booleans or symbolic strings.

### 2. **Boolean or Symbolic Representation**
   - **Boolean Representation**: If parameters are boolean values, they can represent binary choices or states. For example, instead of a weight being a continuous value, it could be represented as a set of binary values, where each binary combination corresponds to a specific action or configuration within the model.
   - **Symbolic Strings**: Symbolic strings can represent more complex structures, such as sequences or patterns that guide the model's behavior. This could be particularly useful in contexts where symbolic reasoning or rule-based approaches are combined with neural networks (e.g., neuro-symbolic AI).

### 3. **Advantages**
   - **Memory Efficiency**: Booleans or symbolic strings can be more memory-efficient than floating-point numbers, especially if the network is large.
   - **Interpretability**: Symbolic strings can be more interpretable, allowing for a clearer understanding of what each parameter represents.
   - **Non-Gradient Optimization**: If parameters are not real numbers, gradient-based methods are not applicable. Instead, other optimization methods like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, or other stochastic approaches can be used.

### 4. **Challenges**
   - **Optimization**: Replacing continuous values with discrete ones removes the ability to use gradient descent directly. This requires developing new optimization strategies, potentially leading to slower convergence or requiring more sophisticated algorithms.
   - **Model Complexity**: The model's complexity might increase as discrete representations could lead to more combinatorial possibilities, making the search space larger and harder to explore.

### 5. **Possible Implementations**
   - **Binary Neural Networks (BNNs)**: These networks already use binary weights and activations, showing that discrete representations can work, albeit with trade-offs in precision and expressiveness.
   - **Neuro-Symbolic AI**: Combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning, where certain parts of the model use symbolic representations, could allow for more flexible and interpretable models.

### 6. **Future Directions**
   - **Hybrid Approaches**: A combination of symbolic/discrete and continuous parameters might be explored to balance efficiency, interpretability, and performance.
   - **Stochastic Training Algorithms**: Developing new algorithms tailored to stochastic estimators with discrete representations could open up new avenues for training neural networks.

In summary, replacing gradient descent-based training with stochastic estimators represented by booleans or symbolic strings is a novel approach that has potential, especially in areas where interpretability and efficiency are critical. However, this would require rethinking the optimization process and possibly developing new methodologies to handle the discrete nature of the parameters.
