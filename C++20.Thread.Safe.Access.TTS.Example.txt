## C++20 Example: Thread-safe Access to Static Member with Mutex

This example demonstrates accessing a static `std::deque` named `phones_strDeque` in the `FPhone` class safely from multiple threads using a mutex.

**Note:** This is a basic example and can be further customized based on your specific needs.

```cpp
#include <deque>
#include <mutex>
#include <thread>

class FPhone {
public:
  static std::deque<std::string> phones_strDeque;
  static std::mutex phonesMutex;

  // Thread-safe accessor function
  static std::deque<std::string> getPhonesCopy() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(phonesMutex);
    return phones_strDeque;
  }

  // Add a phone (assuming thread-safe addition logic)
  void addPhone(const std::string& phone) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(phonesMutex);
    phones_strDeque.push_back(phone);
  }

private:
  // Other member functions and data (if any)
};

// Static member initialization outside the class definition
std::deque<std::string> FPhone::phones_strDeque;
std::mutex FPhone::phonesMutex;

void threadFunction(FPhone& phone) {
  const auto phonesCopy = phone.getPhonesCopy();
  // Do something with the copied phone list (e.g., printing, searching)

  // Add a new phone (assuming thread-safe add logic)
  phone.addPhone("New Phone");
}

int main() {
  FPhone phone;

  // Add some initial phones
  phone.addPhone("Phone 1");
  phone.addPhone("Phone 2");

  // Create and run multiple threads accessing the phone list
  std::vector<std::thread> threads;
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    threads.emplace_back(threadFunction, std::ref(phone));
  }

  for (auto& thread : threads) {
    thread.join();
  }

  // Access the shared phone list after all threads have finished
  const auto finalPhones = FPhone::getPhonesCopy();

  // ...

  return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. The `FPhone` class defines the `phones_strDeque` and `phonesMutex` as static members.
2. The `getPhonesCopy` function provides thread-safe access to the `phones_strDeque` by acquiring a lock on the `phonesMutex` before returning a copy.
3. The `addPhone` function also uses a lock to safely modify the `phones_strDeque`.
4. The `threadFunction` demonstrates how multiple threads can access the `FPhone` object and call the `getPhonesCopy` and `addPhone` functions safely.
5. The `main` function shows how to create and run multiple threads, add initial phones, and access the final list after all threads have finished.

This example illustrates how to use a mutex to synchronize access to a shared resource from multiple threads in C++20. Remember to adapt and extend this code based on your specific needs and desired functionalities.

I hope this helps! Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or need additional clarification.
