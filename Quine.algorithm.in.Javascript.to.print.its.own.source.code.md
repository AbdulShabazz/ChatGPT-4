**Q:** Can you provide a Javascript algorithm that prints its own code ?

**A:** Certainly! A quine is a program that outputs its own source code without taking any input. Here are a few examples of JavaScript quines:

### Basic Quine
This is a simple example of a quine in JavaScript:

```javascript
function quine() {
    console.log(quine.toString() + "\nquine();");
}
quine();
```

### Using Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
This example uses an IIFE to make the quine more elegant:

```javascript
(function quine() {
    console.log('(' + quine.toString() + ')()');
})();
```

### Using Arrow Functions and Template Literals
This example uses modern JavaScript features like arrow functions and template literals:

```javascript
($ => `($=${$})()`)($ => `($=${$})()`);
```

### Explanation
1. **Basic Quine**:
   - The function `quine` prints its own source code by converting itself to a string using `quine.toString()`.
   - The `quine();` call at the end ensures the function is executed.

2. **IIFE Quine**:
   - This version wraps the function in an IIFE, which is immediately invoked after its definition.
   - The function prints its own source code by converting itself to a string and adding the necessary parentheses for invocation.

3. **Arrow Function Quine**:
   - This version uses an arrow function and template literals for a more concise and modern approach.
   - The arrow function is assigned to a variable `$`, which is then used within the template literal to print the function's source code and invoke it.

These examples demonstrate different ways to create a quine in JavaScript, showcasing both traditional and modern JavaScript syntax.
