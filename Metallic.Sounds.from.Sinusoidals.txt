A sinusoidal wave is a pure tone that has only one frequency and amplitude. To create a more metallic sound from a sinusoid, you need to add some harmonics and noise to the wave. Harmonics are multiples of the fundamental frequency that add richness and complexity to the sound. Noise is a random signal that adds brightness and roughness to the sound. 

One way to add harmonics and noise to a sinusoid is to use a technique called frequency modulation (FM) synthesis. FM synthesis involves modulating the frequency of a carrier wave (the sinusoid) with another wave called the modulator. The modulator can have a different frequency, amplitude, and shape than the carrier. By changing the parameters of the modulator, you can create different metallic sounds from the same carrier.

For example, if you use a sinusoid as the modulator, you can create a bell-like sound by choosing a high modulation frequency and a low modulation index (the ratio of the modulation amplitude to the modulation frequency). If you use a sawtooth wave as the modulator, you can create a brass-like sound by choosing a low modulation frequency and a high modulation index. If you use a noise wave as the modulator, you can create a cymbal-like sound by choosing a high modulation frequency and a high modulation index.

You can experiment with different types of waves, frequencies, and indices to create your own metallic sounds from a sinusoid. You can also use multiple modulators to create more complex sounds.
