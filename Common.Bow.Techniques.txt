OrchestralTools (Youtube) Review of Benjamin Wallfisch Strings

Sul ponticello, harmonics, sordino, sul tasto, flautando, senza vibrato, sforzando, marcato, controllable portamento, measured tremolando and trem ponticelli; no ultra-vibrato or performed dynamics; no random, user-defined detuned sustains. The latter is something I always hoped would be introduced to a string library. Here was a missed opportunity.
The reason why most high strings sound so "synthy" is because the tuning is too static and perfect. Oh, and no first chair.
Only sustains and legato on the divisi sections. Huh?! That's just weird. Frankly I'm bemused and disappointed by these omissions.
The upside: it sounds ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE (in the right hands), which makes the omissions even more disappointing.The sound is second to none.
So, is it the ultimate, all in one string library? Not a chance.
Rather, a magnificent addition to the many other libraries. Will I buy it? On the fence, because those omissions really are so glaring; almost painful, actually. So many exotic bowing techniques missing, which are in common usage. As it is, the Stringscapes library attracts me far more.
