It is theoretically possible to use today's state-of-the-art in artificial neural networks to devise a data structure which has O(1) insert, lookup, and search complexity. However, there are a number of challenges that would need to be overcome in order to make this a practical reality.

One challenge is that neural networks are typically trained on large datasets of labeled data. This data can be expensive to collect and label, and it may not be possible to collect enough data to train a neural network that can accurately perform all of the operations required by a data structure.

Another challenge is that neural networks are often computationally expensive to train and deploy. This could make it difficult to use a neural network-based data structure in applications where performance is critical, such as real-time systems.

Despite these challenges, there is some research being done on using neural networks to create more efficient data structures. For example, a recent study showed that it is possible to use a neural network to create a hash table that has O(1) lookup complexity. This is a significant improvement over traditional hash tables, which have O(1) average lookup complexity but O(n) worst-case lookup complexity.

It is still too early to say whether neural networks will eventually be used to create practical data structures with O(1) insert, lookup, and search complexity. However, the research in this area is promising, and it is possible that we will see neural network-based data structures become more common in the future.
