Q:What is the fastest string matching algorithm in computer science?

There isn't a single "fastest" string matching algorithm in computer science, as the performance of a particular algorithm depends on various factors like the size of the text, the size of the pattern, the nature of the text, and the hardware being used. However, some of the most efficient and widely used string matching algorithms include:

    Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
    Boyer-Moore Algorithm
    Rabin-Karp Algorithm
    Aho-Corasick Algorithm
    Z Algorithm

Each of these algorithms has its own strengths and weaknesses, and their performance can vary depending on the specific use case. In some cases, a combination of multiple algorithms or modifications to these algorithms can yield better performance. It is important to analyze the problem at hand and choose the most suitable algorithm for that particular situation.

Q:Specify the computational complexity of these algorithms.

Here's the computational complexity of the mentioned string matching algorithms:

    Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:

    Time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of the text, and m is the length of the pattern.
    Space complexity: O(m), as it requires additional space for the prefix table (also called the failure function or longest proper prefix array).

    Boyer-Moore Algorithm:

    Best-case time complexity: O(n/m), where n is the length of the text, and m is the length of the pattern.
    Average-case time complexity: O(n), assuming the pattern has at least one unique character.
    Worst-case time complexity: O(nm), which occurs when both the text and the pattern have repetitive characters.
    Space complexity: O(k), where k is the size of the alphabet (to store the bad character and good suffix heuristics).

    Rabin-Karp Algorithm:

    Best-case and average-case time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of the text, and m is the length of the pattern.
    Worst-case time complexity: O(nm), which occurs when there are many hash collisions.
    Space complexity: O(1), as it requires constant extra space to store the hash values.

    Aho-Corasick Algorithm:

    Time complexity: O(n + m + z), where n is the length of the text, m is the total length of all patterns, and z is the total number of occurrences of the patterns in the text.
    Space complexity: O(m), where m is the total length of all patterns (to store the trie data structure).

    Z Algorithm:

    Time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of the text, and m is the length of the pattern.
    Space complexity: O(n + m), as it requires additional space to store the concatenated string and Z array.

Note that the actual performance of these algorithms can depend on various factors such as the size of the text and pattern, the nature of the text, and the hardware being used.
