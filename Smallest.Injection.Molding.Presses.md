**Q:** As of your last training, what are the smallest injection molding presses on today's market ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** As of my last update in April 2024, some of the smallest injection molding presses available on the market were:

1. Desktop injection molding machines: These compact units are designed for prototyping and small-scale production. They typically have clamping forces ranging from 1 to 5 tons and shot sizes of a few grams.

2. Micro-injection molding machines: These specialized presses are designed for producing very small parts, often for medical or electronics applications. They can have clamping forces as low as 5 tons and shot sizes in the milligram range.

3. Benchtop injection molding machines: Slightly larger than desktop models but still compact, these machines often have clamping forces between 5 and 20 tons.

Some specific examples of small injection molding presses included:

- The Boy XS from Dr. Boy, with a clamping force of 10 tons
- The Babyplast 6/10P, with a 6.25-ton clamping force
- Various models from companies like Morgan Industries and Nissei, offering machines in the 5-20 ton range

It's worth noting that the market for small and micro injection molding machines has been evolving rapidly, so there may have been newer or smaller models introduced since my last update. If you need the most current information, I'd recommend checking with manufacturers or industry publications for the latest offerings.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
