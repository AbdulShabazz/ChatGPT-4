Bard:

There are two ongoing lawsuits between JPMorgan Chase and Elon Musk.

**Lawsuit over 2018 tweet:**

In August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share. This tweet caused Tesla's stock price to surge, and JPMorgan Chase, which had a contract with Tesla related to stock warrants, claimed that the tweet violated securities laws and caused the bank to suffer losses. In November 2021, JPMorgan Chase sued Tesla for $162.2 million. The lawsuit is still ongoing.

**Subpoena in Jeffrey Epstein-JPMorgan lawsuit:**

In May 2023, Elon Musk was subpoenaed by the US Virgin Islands in its lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase over the bank's ties to Jeffrey Epstein. The US territory alleges that JPMorgan Chase knowingly facilitated Epstein's sex-trafficking operation and that the bank should be held liable for the harm caused to Epstein's victims. Musk was subpoenaed because the USVI believes that Epstein may have referred or attempted to refer Musk to JPMorgan as a client. Musk has complied with the subpoena and has produced documents and testimony. The lawsuit is still ongoing.
