How do I create and register a MIDI output device in C++20 for windows?

ChatGPT:

Creating and registering a MIDI output device for Windows involves interfacing with the Windows Multimedia API (specifically for MIDI, it's often called the Windows MIDI API). Here's a high-level overview of the steps required, followed by some C++20 code to help you get started:
Steps:

    Include necessary headers - You will need windows.h for most of the Windows API functions.

    Enumerate MIDI Out Devices - Before creating a device, you might want to see what devices are already available.

    Open a MIDI Out Device - Use the midiOutOpen function.

    Send MIDI messages - Once you have a handle to a MIDI output device, you can send messages using midiOutShortMsg for short messages and midiOutLongMsg for system-exclusive messages.

    Close the MIDI Device - Don't forget to release the device using midiOutClose when you're done.

Sample C++20 Code:

cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>

int main() {
    // Enumerate MIDI output devices
    unsigned int numDevs = midiOutGetNumDevs();
    if (numDevs == 0) {
        std::cout << "No MIDI output devices found!" << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < numDevs; i++) {
        MIDIOUTCAPS moc;
        if (midiOutGetDevCaps(i, &moc, sizeof(MIDIOUTCAPS)) == MMSYSERR_NOERROR) {
            std::cout << "Device " << i << ": " << moc.szPname << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // Open the first MIDI output device
    HMIDIOUT hMidiOut = NULL;
    if (midiOutOpen(&hMidiOut, 0, 0, 0, CALLBACK_NULL) != MMSYSERR_NOERROR) {
        std::cout << "Error opening MIDI output device." << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    // Send a MIDI message (e.g., a Note On for middle C on channel 1)
    DWORD midiMessage = 0x00403C90;  // 0x90 is Note On for channel 1, 0x3C is middle C, 0x40 is velocity of 64
    if (midiOutShortMsg(hMidiOut, midiMessage) != MMSYSERR_NOERROR) {
        std::cout << "Error sending MIDI message." << std::endl;
    }

    Sleep(1000);  // Let the note play for a second

    // Close the MIDI output device
    midiOutClose(hMidiOut);

    return 0;
}

This is a basic example and a real-world application would involve more error handling, possibly the ability to send longer sequences of messages, and more advanced User interfaces.

To compile this code, you'll need to link against winmm.lib, which provides the necessary functions for working with the Windows Multimedia API.

How do include winmm.lib in my project?

ChatGPT:

Including winmm.lib in your project depends on the development environment and build system you're using. Here's how to do it in some common environments:
1. Visual Studio:

Using the Visual Studio IDE:

    Open your project in Visual Studio.
    In the Solution Explorer, right-click on your project and select "Properties."
    Navigate to Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input.
    In the "Additional Dependencies" field, add winmm.lib.
    Click "OK" to save the changes and close the properties window.

Using a CMake file:
If you use CMake to generate your Visual Studio solution, you can link against winmm.lib by adding the following line to your CMakeLists.txt:

cmake

target_link_libraries(YourTargetName winmm.lib)

2. GCC or MinGW:

If you're using the GCC or MinGW compiler, you can include winmm.lib using the -l command line option:

g++ your_source.cpp -o your_program.exe -lwinmm

3. Clang:

The process is similar to GCC. When using Clang on Windows (especially if it's using the Microsoft ABI, like when using clang-cl), you can link with winmm.lib as follows:

clang++ your_source.cpp -o your_program.exe -lwinmm

Make sure to include this library whenever you're compiling any program that makes calls to the Windows Multimedia API functions, otherwise, you'll encounter linker errors.
