Does anyone manufacture external RAM equipment?

ChatGPT:

As of my last update in September 2021, there isn't "external RAM" in the way that you might think of external hard drives. However, there are a few concepts and technologies that might be relevant to the idea of expanding memory or performance:

    RAM Disk: Some software can create a "RAM disk," which is a virtual drive on your computer that uses RAM as its storage medium. This can dramatically speed up tasks like file access or program execution, but it isn't the same as expanding system RAM.

    ReadyBoost: This is a feature introduced with Windows Vista. It allows USB drives (like flash drives) to act as a cache, which can improve system performance. However, it's not as effective as upgrading the actual system RAM.

    Virtual RAM: Some operating systems can use a section of the hard drive as "virtual RAM" or "swap space." This is much slower than actual RAM but can provide more memory space for applications if physical RAM is exhausted.

    External Graphics Cards (eGPUs): While not related to RAM, eGPUs allow users to connect a powerful graphics card to a laptop or desktop via Thunderbolt or another high-speed connection. This can boost graphic-intensive tasks and gaming performance.

    Server-based computing: In environments like data centers, it's common to allocate memory from a pool of resources to specific machines or tasks. This doesn't apply to typical consumer scenarios but is a form of "external" resource allocation.

If you're looking to improve the performance of your computer, the best approach, in most cases, is to physically upgrade the RAM in the machine, if possible. If you're referring to a different or emerging technology post-2021, I might not be aware of it, so it would be good to check the latest sources or manufacturer websites.
