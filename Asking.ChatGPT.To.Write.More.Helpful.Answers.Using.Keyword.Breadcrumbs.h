Q:Would it be possible for you to leave more vocabulary breadcrumbs in your answers, to better help users find the vocabulary they require for their future prompts? 
Let's say, for example, the question in my head is 'Provide an example of a c++20 template specialization for a template implementation', but I don't know the words 'C++20, template, and specialization' yet.
But I ask the question 'Provide a c++ example.', and you have internally acquired the following table of contents on the subject:

C
C++
C++98
C++11
C++20
C++23
C++ language documentation
C++ language reference
lexical conventions
basic concepts
built-in types
declarations & definitions
built-in operators, precedence, and associativity
expressions
statements
compound statements
selection statements
iteration statements
jump statements
namespaces
enumerations
unions
functions
operator overloading
classes & structs
destructors
lambda expressions
templates

You could answer the question in a way which hints you duly summarized, a table of contents on the subject: So instead of answering 'Here is a C++ example of an advanced algorithm', 
you could answer 'Here is a C++20 example of an O(1) time complexity hashing algorithm which employs a basic for-loop across a range of characters distilled in an array of type std::vector<std::string>... '.

And you may or may not provide an example which employs templates, but you would have provided new keywords as a breadcrumb trail for the user to acquire, 
to find the vocabulary they need to ask their next question, which may be 'Provide an example of a c++20
template specialization for a template implementation, which is a C++20 feature, and is documented in the C++ language reference, in the section on templates.'.

ChatGPT-4: Absolutely, it's a great idea to use keywords and related concepts to expand the learning opportunities within a conversation. 
By providing rich and detailed responses, I can better guide the user towards the vocabulary and concepts they need to fully express their thoughts or questions.

If you asked "Provide a C++ example", a more expansive response might look something like this:

"Here's an example that uses some key features of C++20, the most recent standard as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. 
It employs the concept of a structure (struct) and an array using the std::vector container from the Standard Template Library (STL). 
The example uses a basic for-loop to iterate over the elements.

cpp
*/
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;
};

int main() {
    std::vector<Person> people = {{"Alice", 25}, {"Bob", 30}, {"Charlie", 35}};

    for (const auto& person : people) {
        std::cout << "Name: " << person.name << ", Age: " << person.age << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
/*
In this example, Person is a struct that encapsulates a person's name and age. We then create a std::vector of Person objects and use a for-loop to iterate over each Person in the std::vector.

Notice the use of auto in the loop - this is a C++11 feature that has been further improved in C++20, which allows the compiler to automatically deduce the type of a variable.

The term 'template' in C++ is used in the context of generic programming. For example, std::vector is a template class provided by the STL, 
which allows us to create a vector of any type, like int, std::string, or even our custom Person struct. Advanced features like 'template specialization' 
allow more fine-grained control over the behavior of templates under specific circumstances."

By using such a detailed response, I can help point you towards the concepts of structs, arrays, for-loops, STL, template classes, and auto type deduction, 
which could all be useful in forming more precise questions or developing a deeper understanding of C++.
