Creating a log-mel cepstral coefficient (LMCC) spectrograph in C++20 without using third-party libraries is a challenging task, as it involves several intricate steps such as Fourier transformations, mel scaling, and logarithmic compression. C++ standard library doesn't provide direct support for digital signal processing tasks, so we'll have to implement these from scratch. Here's a high-level outline of the algorithm, followed by a more detailed implementation guide.

### High-Level Algorithm Outline:

1. **Read Audio Input:**
   - Process audio data (typically WAV files).
   - Extract raw audio samples.

2. **Pre-Emphasis:**
   - Apply a pre-emphasis filter to the signal to amplify high frequencies.

3. **Frame Blocking:**
   - Divide the signal into frames of N samples, typically with overlap.

4. **Windowing:**
   - Apply a window function (like Hamming) to each frame.

5. **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):**
   - Convert each frame from time domain to frequency domain.

6. **Mel Filter Bank Processing:**
   - Apply mel scale filter banks to the power spectrum of each frame.

7. **Logarithmic Compression:**
   - Take the logarithm of each mel filter bank energy.

8. **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT):**
   - Convert the log-mel spectrum to the time domain, resulting in cepstral coefficients.

### Detailed Implementation Guide:

#### 1. Read Audio Input:
   - Use standard file I/O operations.
   - Extract audio data, ensuring to handle stereo/mono and various bit depths.

#### 2. Pre-Emphasis:
   - Implement a simple first-order high-pass filter.
   - Formula: `filtered[n] = audio[n] - pre_emphasis * audio[n-1]`.

#### 3. Frame Blocking:
   - Loop over the signal in steps, creating overlapping frames.
   - Typically, frames are 20-40 ms long, with 50% overlap.

#### 4. Windowing:
   - Apply the Hamming window: `windowed[n] = frame[n] * (0.54 - 0.46 * cos(2 * Ï€ * n / (N-1)))`.

#### 5. FFT:
   - Implement the FFT algorithm (Cooley-Tukey or similar).
   - Convert each frame to the frequency domain.

#### 6. Mel Filter Bank Processing:
   - Convert frequency to Mel scale: `mel(f) = 2595 * log10(1 + f/700)`.
   - Create filter banks and apply them to the power spectrum.

#### 7. Logarithmic Compression:
   - Logarithmically scale the filter bank energies: `log_energy = log(filter_bank_energy)`.

#### 8. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT):
   - Implement the DCT.
   - Convert log-mel energies to cepstral coefficients.

### Considerations and Limitations:
- **Performance**: This implementation might be less efficient than using specialized libraries.
- **Accuracy**: Self-implemented algorithms may have lower accuracy and robustness compared to tested third-party libraries.
- **Complexity**: Implementing FFT, DCT, and filter banks from scratch is complex and error-prone.
- **Audio File Processing**: Handling different audio formats and bit depths adds complexity.

### Conclusion:
Implementing a log-mel cepstral coefficient spectrograph entirely in C++20 without third-party libraries is feasible but requires a significant amount of manual implementation and testing. In practical scenarios, leveraging libraries like FFTW for FFT or others for audio processing is recommended to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and robustness.
