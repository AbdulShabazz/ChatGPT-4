Yes, it is possible to record simultaneously using both the front and rear camera on an iPhone. However, you cannot do this using the native Camera app. You will need to use a third-party app.

Here are some third-party apps that you can use to record simultaneously using both the front and rear camera on an iPhone:

* **Double Take:** This app is made by Filmic and it allows you to record from any two cameras on your iPhone, including the front and rear cameras. You can also choose to record in split-screen mode or picture-in-picture mode.
