**Q:** If the electrostatic surface area were relocated to the perimeter of the headphone and a more rigid diaphragm employed, could the performance of electrostatic headphones be improved ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Relocating the electrostatic surface area to the perimeter of the headphone and employing a more rigid diaphragm could potentially improve the performance of electrostatic headphones, but it would also introduce several challenges and trade-offs.

### Potential Improvements

1. **Increased Surface Area**: By relocating the electrostatic surface area to the perimeter, you could potentially increase the overall surface area of the diaphragm. This could lead to a more uniform electric field and potentially better sound quality, as the diaphragm would be more evenly driven across its entire surface[2][16].

2. **Enhanced Rigidity**: Using a more rigid diaphragm could reduce unwanted resonances and distortions, leading to clearer and more accurate sound reproduction. Rigid diaphragms tend to distort less at higher sound pressure levels (SPL), which could improve the overall fidelity of the headphones[20].

3. **Improved Bass Response**: A larger diaphragm surface area could also improve the low-frequency response, addressing one of the common criticisms of electrostatic headphones, which is their lack of bass performance[11].

### Challenges and Trade-offs

1. **Increased Weight**: A more rigid diaphragm is likely to be heavier, which could affect the comfort and wearability of the headphones. Electrostatic headphones are prized for their lightweight diaphragms, which contribute to their fast transient response and low distortion[16][12].

2. **Complexity in Design**: Relocating the electrostatic surface area to the perimeter would require a significant redesign of the headphone structure. This could introduce new engineering challenges, such as ensuring uniform tension across the diaphragm and maintaining the necessary electrical insulation[2][7].

3. **Potential for Increased Distortion**: While a more rigid diaphragm can reduce certain types of distortion, it can also introduce new issues, such as spiky breakup modes. These can cause unwanted resonances at specific frequencies, which would need to be carefully managed through design and material choices[20].

4. **Manufacturing Difficulties**: Implementing these changes could complicate the manufacturing process, potentially increasing costs and reducing the feasibility of mass production. Electrostatic headphones already require precise manufacturing techniques, and adding complexity could exacerbate these challenges[15][11].

### Conclusion

While relocating the electrostatic surface area to the perimeter and using a more rigid diaphragm could theoretically improve the performance of electrostatic headphones, the practical implementation of these changes would require careful consideration of the associated challenges. The potential benefits in sound quality and bass response must be weighed against the increased weight, design complexity, potential for new distortions, and manufacturing difficulties. Therefore, any such redesign would need to be approached with a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of electrostatic headphone design.
