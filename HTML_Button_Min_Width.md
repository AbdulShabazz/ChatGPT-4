To ensure an HTML button is not below a minimum width yet is allowed to expand, you can achieve this by using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Specifically, you would use the `min-width` property to set the minimum width the button should have, ensuring it doesn't get smaller than this size. Additionally, you can allow the button to expand beyond this minimum width based on its content or external constraints by not setting a `max-width` or by setting it to a higher value. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        .expandable-button {
            min-width: 100px; /* Replace 100px with your desired minimum width */
            padding: 10px; /* Add some padding for aesthetics */
            /* Optional styles */
            display: inline-block; /* Allows the button to expand based on content */
            white-space: nowrap; /* Ensures text doesn't wrap */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<button class="expandable-button">Short</button>
<button class="expandable-button">This is a much longer button text</button>

</body>
</html>
```

Here's what's happening in the CSS:

- `min-width: 100px;` ensures that the button will not be smaller than 100 pixels in width. You can adjust this value as needed.
- `padding: 10px;` adds some space inside the button around the content, making it more visually appealing. Adjust as needed.
- `display: inline-block;` allows the button to grow with its content, unlike `display: block;` which would make it fill its container's width.
- `white-space: nowrap;` prevents the text inside the button from wrapping to a new line, which helps maintain the button's appearance. If you want the text to wrap in smaller containers, you can remove this line.

This setup ensures that your button has a minimum width and can expand based on the content it contains or according to the layout constraints placed upon it by its container.
