Why don't automotive brake calipers surround the entire rotor?

ChatGPT:

Brake calipers do not surround the entire rotor for several reasons:

    Heat Dissipation: Brake rotors get extremely hot during braking, especially during heavy or sustained use. If a caliper surrounded the entire rotor, it would trap heat, making it harder for the rotor to cool down. This could lead to reduced brake performance, overheating, and even brake failure.

    Weight: A full-surround caliper would be much heavier than a partial one. This additional weight would negatively impact the vehicle's overall performance, fuel efficiency, and handling.

    Cost: Producing a caliper that surrounds the entire rotor would be more expensive both in terms of material and manufacturing.

    Flexibility and Adjustments: With the current design, it's easier to adjust and service individual brake components, such as changing pads or rotors. A full-surround design would make such tasks more difficult and time-consuming.

    Dynamics and Balancing: A rotor needs to be balanced to prevent vibrations. If a caliper surrounded the entire rotor, this could affect the dynamic balance of the rotor and lead to vibration issues.

    Rotor Expansion: Brake rotors can expand slightly when they heat up. If a caliper surrounded the rotor entirely, there might be no room for this expansion, which could lead to binding or warping.

    Caliper Design Simplicity: A simpler caliper design means fewer potential points of failure, making them more reliable.

    Effectiveness: Current caliper designs, even though they don't surround the rotor, are very effective at stopping vehicles. There's little to gain in terms of performance by making them more complicated and heavier.

In short, the current design of brake calipers is a result of a balance between efficiency, effectiveness, and practical considerations.

Why not split the rotor and insert the calipers on its interior face?

ChatGPT:

Inserting brake calipers on the interior face of a split rotor is an intriguing idea. This would essentially be an "inboard braking" system. While this concept has been explored and even implemented in some cases, it's not widespread for several reasons:

    Heat Management: Moving the brake mechanism inboard would result in a concentration of heat in a location that isn't as exposed to ambient air as traditional brakes. This could compromise brake performance and longevity, especially if adequate cooling isn't provided.

    Maintenance: Inboard brakes would be harder to access, making inspections, service, and repairs more time-consuming and potentially more expensive.

    Weight Distribution: One of the advantages of inboard brakes is that they can reduce unsprung weight, which can improve handling. However, this benefit is offset by the fact that the weight is moved closer to the vehicle's center, potentially affecting other aspects of its dynamics.

    Complexity: Adding a split rotor with inboard brakes adds complexity to the braking system. This can increase the points of potential failure and raise manufacturing costs.

    Dirt and Debris: Inboard brakes are more protected from road debris, water, and dirt. While this might sound like a benefit, brakes actually rely on their exposure to open air to help clean and dry the rotors. A system that's too shielded might accumulate moisture and debris, leading to reduced performance or increased wear.

    Heat Transfer to Other Components: Inboard brakes can transfer heat to nearby components, like the differential or suspension components. This could lead to premature wear or failure of those components if not adequately managed.

    Space: Inboard brakes require space near the vehicle's centerline. This could conflict with other components, especially in front-wheel-drive vehicles where the engine and transmission already occupy a significant portion of available space.

While there are potential advantages to an inboard braking system (such as reduced unsprung weight), the drawbacks have generally made it less appealing for widespread automotive use. However, it's worth noting that inboard brakes have been used in certain racing applications and some production vehicles in the past where the benefits outweighed the drawbacks for the specific use case.

Why not substitute an electric motor, and exploit it's 'regen' capability exclusively for braking?

ChatGPT:

Using an electric motor's regenerative braking capability exclusively for stopping a vehicle is an interesting idea, and it's already employed to some extent in electric and hybrid vehicles. However, there are challenges and considerations that make it inadvisable to rely solely on regenerative braking:

    Limited Braking Force: Regenerative braking relies on converting the kinetic energy of the moving vehicle back into electrical energy, which is stored in the battery. This process has limits in terms of how much energy it can recapture quickly. In emergency braking situations or when quick deceleration is needed, regenerative braking alone might not provide sufficient braking force.

    Battery State-of-Charge: The efficiency of regenerative braking is affected by the battery's state-of-charge. If a battery is near its capacity, it can't accept much more energy, which can limit the effectiveness of regenerative braking. Conversely, if the battery is depleted, it might not provide the necessary resistance for effective regenerative braking.

    Low-Speed Limitations: Regenerative braking is less effective at very low speeds. Traditional friction brakes are required to bring a vehicle to a complete stop from low speeds or to hold it stationary, especially on inclines.

    Fail-Safes and Redundancy: Relying on a single system for braking can be risky. Traditional braking systems offer a backup in case the primary system fails. With regenerative braking, if there's an electrical or motor issue, you'd have no braking capability without a secondary system.

    Variability in Conditions: Regenerative braking's effectiveness can vary based on road conditions, tire grip, and other factors. In situations like driving on ice or wet roads, the regenerative braking system might not respond as predictably as traditional friction brakes.

    Heat Dissipation: While regenerative braking generates less heat than friction braking, there's still heat produced in the motor and electronics. Prolonged braking, such as descending a long hill, could lead to overheating if only relying on regenerative braking.

    Driver Expectation: Drivers are accustomed to the feel and response of traditional braking systems. Transitioning to a system that relies solely on regenerative braking would require a significant adjustment and could lead to safety issues if not implemented with care.

For these reasons, while regenerative braking is a valuable tool for recovering energy and reducing wear on traditional brakes, it's not currently feasible or advisable to use it as the exclusive means of stopping a vehicle.

Why not feed the energy captured during regenerative braking back into the motor to induce further braking?

ChatGPT:

Using the energy captured during regenerative braking to feed back into the motor for additional braking is essentially the principle behind regenerative braking. When you engage regenerative braking, the motor operates in reverse (as a generator) to resist the rotation of the wheels, converting some of the kinetic energy back into electrical energy. This resistance slows the vehicle down.

However, if you're suggesting using the stored energy immediately to create an additional braking force by running the motor in the opposite direction, there are several challenges and considerations:

    Complexity: Implementing a system that captures energy and then immediately uses it to induce further braking would add complexity to the vehicle's control systems. Deciding when and how to deploy this braking mechanism would require sophisticated controls and sensors.

    Braking Force Limitation: Electric motors can only provide so much resistance. Once they reach their maximum braking capacity, any additional energy fed back into them won't produce more braking force.

    Energy Conversion Efficiency: Every time energy is converted from one form to another, there are losses. When kinetic energy is converted to electrical energy and then immediately back to kinetic energy, the efficiency drop could make the process less effective than simply using the initial regenerative braking.

    Heat Production: Electric motors generate heat when they operate. Using the motor for both regenerative braking and then immediate braking could produce a significant amount of heat, which might lead to overheating or reduce the lifespan of the motor and associated electronics.

    Predictability: For safety reasons, vehicle braking behavior needs to be predictable. Introducing another layer of dynamic braking could make the braking response less predictable, especially in varying conditions.

    Battery State and Health: Rapidly charging and discharging the battery can affect its health and lifespan. Continuously cycling energy in this way could degrade the battery more quickly.

    Unnecessary Wear: Using the motor for additional braking when it's not strictly necessary might introduce unnecessary wear and reduce its lifespan.

While the concept is intriguing and has potential for specific applications or in combination with other technologies, relying solely on it might not be the most efficient or safe way to enhance braking in general automotive use.

Why not employ a battery powered reverse motor whose forward operation is opposite that of the spinning wheels?

ChatGPT:

Using a separate, battery-powered reverse motor whose forward operation is opposite that of the spinning wheels is an interesting concept. Essentially, you're suggesting using a motor to generate opposing force for braking. Here's a breakdown of the idea and its challenges:

    Complexity: Integrating an additional motor solely for braking adds complexity to the vehicle design. This could increase the number of potential failure points and the overall cost of the vehicle.

    Control and Predictability: A braking system needs to provide predictable and consistent deceleration in various conditions. Ensuring that the reverse motor provides the right amount of braking force without causing wheel lock-up or skidding could be challenging.

    Weight: An additional motor adds weight to the vehicle, which affects its overall efficiency, handling, and performance.

    Space: Modern vehicles are tightly packaged with components optimized for space. Adding another motor for braking would require significant design modifications.

    Efficiency: Every time energy is converted, there are losses. In this case, you'd be converting stored electrical energy in the battery to kinetic energy in the reverse motor. There would be losses associated with this conversion, potentially making it less efficient than other braking methods.

    Redundancy: If the main propulsion motor fails or encounters an issue, relying on a secondary motor for braking can be risky. A conventional braking system provides redundancy, ensuring that the vehicle can stop even if there's an electrical or motor issue.

    Maintenance: Adding another motor introduces another set of components that require maintenance, inspections, and potential repairs.

    Heat Generation: Motors generate heat during operation. Using a motor for braking, especially during prolonged braking situations, could lead to overheating issues.

    Cost: Developing, integrating, and maintaining an additional motor system for braking would likely increase the overall cost of the vehicle.

While the concept is novel and could have potential niche applications, there are challenges to overcome. Current regenerative braking systems and conventional friction brakes, used in tandem, offer a balanced approach to efficiency, safety, and reliability in most vehicle applications.
