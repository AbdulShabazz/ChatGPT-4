**Q:** What are the circumstances when players will highly rate a game of exceeding difficulty ?

**A:** Players often highly rate games of exceeding difficulty under several circumstances:

1. **Sense of Accomplishment**: Overcoming challenging obstacles provides a significant sense of achievement. Players feel a deep sense of satisfaction and pride when they conquer difficult tasks, which can be more rewarding than completing easier games[11][13].

2. **Fairness and Skill Development**: Games that are difficult but fair, where failure is attributed to the player's mistakes rather than unfair mechanics, are often appreciated. This fairness allows players to learn from their mistakes and improve their skills, making the eventual success even more gratifying[9][16].

3. **Engagement and Intrinsic Motivation**: Difficult games can keep players highly engaged by providing continuous challenges that require strategic thinking and skill development. This engagement is often driven by intrinsic motivation, where players are motivated by the challenge itself rather than external rewards[12][15].

4. **Replay Value**: High difficulty can add replay value to a game. Players may return to the game to improve their performance, try different strategies, or achieve better results, which extends the game's lifespan and enhances its overall value[17].

5. **Community and Bragging Rights**: Successfully completing a difficult game can provide social capital within gaming communities. Players often share their achievements and strategies, gaining respect and recognition from their peers[11][13].

These factors contribute to why players might rate highly difficult games positively, as they offer a unique and rewarding experience that easier games may not provide.
