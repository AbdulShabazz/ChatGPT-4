The perceived improvement in sound quality when using headphones with a more powerful amplifier, even at the same volume level, can be attributed to several factors related to the amplifier's performance and its interaction with the headphones. It's not merely about the maximum power output capability (e.g., 100 W vs. 2 W) but also about the quality of the amplification, the design characteristics of the amplifier, and how it drives the headphones. Here's why a more powerful amplifier can sound better:

Headroom

Dynamic Headroom: More powerful amplifiers generally provide greater headroom, meaning they can handle peaks in the music without distortion. Even at normal listening levels, musical peaks require brief bursts of power far above the average level. A high-power amplifier can deliver these peaks cleanly, ensuring the music sounds more dynamic and lifelike.

Lower Distortion

Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): Amplifiers with higher power ratings often exhibit lower total harmonic distortion at the same output levels compared to less powerful amplifiers. This means that the signal is reproduced more accurately, contributing to clearer and more detailed sound.

Improved Damping Factor

Control Over Headphone Drivers: The damping factor, a ratio of headphone impedance to amplifier output impedance, influences how well the amplifier can control the movement of the headphone drivers. A more powerful amplifier, especially one designed with a low output impedance, can offer better control over the headphone drivers, leading to tighter bass response and a more accurate reproduction of the audio signal.

Better Design and Components

Quality of Components: Higher-powered amplifiers, especially those designed for high-fidelity audio, often utilize higher-quality components and circuit designs. These can reduce noise, improve frequency response, and ensure more linear amplification across different frequencies, all contributing to better sound quality.

Efficient Power Delivery

Adequate Power Delivery: While your headphones may not need 100 W of power, an amplifier capable of such output can easily provide clean, undistorted power at lower levels. This efficient power delivery ensures that the amplifier operates well within its limits, maintaining sound fidelity even during dynamic passages in music.

Psychological Aspect
 
Perceived Quality: There's also a psychological component where knowing you're using a more capable amplifier can influence your perception of the audio quality. However, this subjective factor complements the objective improvements mentioned above.

Conclusion

It's important to note that more power doesn't automatically mean better sound for all headphones. The synergy between the headphones and the amplifier, including impedance matching and the quality of the amplifier's design, plays a critical role. A well-designed amplifier, capable of delivering clean and stable power beyond the immediate demands of the headphones, can enhance the listening experience by ensuring the audio is reproduced with minimal distortion, greater dynamic range, and accurate driver control. This is why a higher-powered amplifier might sound better at the same volume level compared to a lower-powered one.
