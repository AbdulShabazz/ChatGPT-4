According to a 2021 Nevada law, a (closed-booth) presidential primary election must be held for every major party, and only voters who are registered with the Democratic or Republican party are allowed to vote⁴. However, the Nevada Republican Party decided to hold a (public vote) caucus anyway, and exclude candidates who choose to have their name listed on the ballot for the state-run primary³. The caucus will be the only way for candidates to win delegates regardless of the outcome of the primary². This means that some Republican candidates will be competing in two different races, but only the caucus will matter for the nomination. The Nevada presidential preference primaries will be held on Feb. 6, 2024, and the Republican caucus will be held on Feb. 8, 2024¹.

The law that mandated a presidential primary election for every major party in Nevada was enacted in 2021, with the support of the Democratic governor and legislature⁴. The reasons for the law change included:
- To increase voter participation and convenience by allowing mail-in ballots and early voting options²⁵.
- To boost Nevada's influence and relevance in the presidential nomination process by moving up the primary date to February⁵.
- To avoid the confusion and errors that plagued the 2020 caucuses, which relied on complex formulas and faulty technology³⁵.

However, the Nevada Republican Party opposed the law and decided to hold a separate caucus to allocate their delegates, claiming that the primary would infringe on their right to choose their own nominee¹². They also argued that the caucus would foster more grassroots engagement and loyalty among their voters¹.

However, some experts have argued that the Nevada Republican Party's decision to hold a caucus and ignore the primary results may violate the state law that requires a presidential primary election for every major party⁴⁵. They also claim that the caucus may disenfranchise some voters who prefer the convenience and privacy of the primary, or who are unable to attend the caucus due to work, health, or other reasons²⁵. On the other hand, the Nevada Republican Party has defended its right to choose its own nominee and delegate allocation method, and has cited previous court rulings that upheld the autonomy of political parties¹³. Ultimately, the legality of the caucus may depend on whether any lawsuits are filed to challenge it, and how the courts interpret the state law and the party's rights.
