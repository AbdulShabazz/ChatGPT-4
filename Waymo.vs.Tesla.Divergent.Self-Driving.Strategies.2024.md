**Q:** Waymo and Tesla corporate self-driving strategies are different. Waymo has achieved level 3 certification on public streets in tandem with remote drivers for assistance, while Tesla FSD utilizes streets and roadways and seeks level 5 certification in China. Which company is ahead ?

**A:** As of August 2023, it's difficult to say definitively which company is ahead in the race for fully autonomous vehicles. Both Waymo and Tesla have made significant progress but have taken different approaches.

Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google's parent company), has focused on developing autonomous driving technology through a more gradual and cautious approach. They have achieved Level 4 autonomy in certain geofenced areas, meaning their vehicles can operate without human intervention under specific conditions. Waymo has been testing its self-driving technology in public, with a fleet of autonomous taxis operating in Phoenix, Arizona. They have also expanded their testing to other cities, such as San Francisco.

Tesla, on the other hand, has taken a more aggressive approach with its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Tesla's FSD is an advanced driver-assistance system that aims to eventually achieve Level 5 autonomy, which would allow the vehicle to drive itself under all conditions. Tesla has been collecting vast amounts of real-world driving data from its customers' vehicles to train and improve its FSD system. However, as of August 2023, Tesla's FSD still requires human supervision and is not considered fully autonomous.

It's important to note that achieving Level 5 autonomy is an extremely challenging task, and no company has yet demonstrated a fully autonomous vehicle that can operate in all conditions without human intervention. Regulatory approval is also a significant hurdle for both companies, as governments need to ensure the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles before allowing them to operate on public roads without restrictions.

In summary, both Waymo and Tesla have made significant strides in autonomous driving technology, but they have taken different approaches. Waymo's more cautious strategy has allowed them to achieve Level 4 autonomy in certain areas, while Tesla's aggressive push towards Level 5 autonomy has yielded advanced driver-assistance features. As of August 2023, it remains to be seen which company will ultimately come out ahead in the race for fully autonomous vehicles.
