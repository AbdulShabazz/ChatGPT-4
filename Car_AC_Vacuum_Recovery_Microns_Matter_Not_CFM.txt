Q:How much CFM vacuum pressure is required to vacuum out automotive AC refrigerant ?

Here's a breakdown of the vacuum requirements for automotive AC refrigerant systems:

CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute):

    CFM isn't the primary focus: CFM measures the airflow volume your vacuum pump can pull. While a higher CFM will evacuate the system faster, the depth of the vacuum is more critical for auto AC work.
    Minimum CFM: A 3 CFM vacuum pump is the typical minimum recommendation, but even a 1.5 CFM pump can suffice for smaller systems if you allow more time for the evacuation process.

Ultimate Vacuum (measured in microns):

    The key factor: This is the depth of vacuum the pump can achieve, a more important metric than CFM.
    Recommended depth: Aim for an ultimate vacuum of 500 microns or lower. The deeper the vacuum, the more effectively you'll remove moisture and non-condensable gases that can harm your AC system.

Other Factors:

    System size: Larger AC systems may benefit from a more powerful pump to evacuate the system faster.
    Ambient temperature: Cold temperatures can slow the evacuation process.
    Vacuum pump quality: A well-maintained, high-quality vacuum pump will achieve a better vacuum.

Important Notes:

    Holding vacuum: After reaching your target vacuum, shut off the pump and monitor the system for at least 30 minutes to ensure there are no leaks.
    Oil changes: Change your vacuum pump oil regularly to maintain good performance.

Q:After I attach and initiate the AC recharge system and read off the current high pressure and low pressure readings, how do I know how much refrigerant is in the system and how much is needed to drain or add ?

Unfortunately, you can't determine the exact amount of refrigerant in your car's AC system based solely on pressure readings from your manifold gauges. Here's why:

    Pressure-Temperature Relationship: Refrigerant pressure varies with temperature. A hot day will yield different pressures than a cold one, even if the refrigerant amount is the same.
    System Capacity: AC systems differ in their total refrigerant capacity. A larger system might show similar pressures to a smaller system with less refrigerant.
    Other Factors: Leaks, restrictions, and the compressor's efficiency can also influence pressures.

How to Properly Determine Refrigerant Level:

    Vehicle Specifications: The most reliable way is to find your car's AC refrigerant capacity. It's usually on:
        A sticker under the hood
        Your owner's manual
        Online resources specific to your make and model
    Full Evacuation and Weighing:
        Evacuate the system completely using your vacuum pump.
        Use a refrigerant scale to weigh the extracted refrigerant. Compare this to your vehicle's specification.
    Charging by Weight:
        After a full evacuation, recharge the system with the precise amount of refrigerant specified for your vehicle, again using a refrigerant scale.

Interpreting Pressure Readings (but not for exact refrigerant level):

While pressures don't directly tell you the refrigerant amount, they provide valuable clues:

    Reference Charts: Compare your pressure readings to a pressure-temperature (PT) chart for the specific refrigerant you're using (usually R134a). This can indicate if your system is generally overcharged, undercharged, or close to normal levels.
    System Behavior: Observing pressures as you charge the system and monitoring vent temperatures can provide further insight.

Important Note: If you suspect a leak, evacuating the system and holding a vacuum for an extended period is the best way to confirm its integrity before recharging.

Let me know if you'd like help finding your vehicle's refrigerant specifications or understanding how to use pressure charts!

Q:Why, and or when, should I evacuate a system that is under pressurized ?

Here are the key reasons why you would evacuate an AC system even if it's still under some pressure:

1. Moisture Removal:

    The Primary Reason: Evacuation removes moisture from the system, which is critical for preventing system damage. Moisture can:
        React with refrigerant and oil, forming acids that corrode internal components
        Freeze inside the system, causing blockages
        Lead to reduced cooling performance

    Even Slight Pressure: Even if the system has a bit of pressure, there's still a high chance of moisture being present. A deep vacuum effectively boils off this moisture.

2. Non-Condensable Gases:

    Air and other gases: If the system has a leak, air and other non-condensable gases can enter. These don't behave like refrigerant and will:
        Reduce system efficiency
        Increase operating pressures

    Removing Them: Evacuation is the only way to remove these gases.

3. Major Repairs:

    Replacement of parts: When replacing significant AC components (compressor, condenser, evaporator), it's critical to evacuate the system afterward to remove any debris or moisture introduced during the process.

4. Changing Refrigerant Types:

    Retrofitting: If you're converting from an older refrigerant (like R12) to a newer one (like R134a), thorough evacuation is essential to remove residual old refrigerant and avoid contamination.

5. Known or Suspected Leak:

    Before Recharging: If you've fixed a leak, you need to evacuate the system and monitor it to ensure the repair was successful. After it holds the vacuum, you can recharge with refrigerant.

Important Safety Note:  While you can technically evacuate a system under pressure, use caution. If the pressure is high, it could indicate a serious issue. If unsure, having a certified mechanic assess the system is the safest choice.

Let me know if you have any more questions about evacuation or specific scenarios!

Q:What is the best way to evacuate the AC system ?

Here's a detailed guide on the best way to evacuate an automotive AC system, combining safety, effectiveness, and practical considerations:

Preparation

    Safety First: Wear safety glasses and gloves. Refrigerant can cause cold burns and eye damage.
    Gather Materials: Ensure you have a vacuum pump, manifold gauge set, AC hoses, refrigerant scale (if recharging), and any leak detection equipment.
    Identify Refrigerant Type: Check your vehicle's manual or under-hood sticker to confirm the correct refrigerant type.

Evacuation Procedure

    Connect the System:
        Locate your AC service ports (high side and low side).
        Connect your manifold gauges to service ports with correct hoses (blue for low, red for high).
        Attach the center hose (usually yellow) from your gauge set to the vacuum pump.
    Open Manifold Valves: Open both high-side and low-side valves on the gauge set.
    Start the Vacuum Pump: Turn on the pump and let it run. Monitor the gauges, and the vacuum will begin to drop.
    Achieve Deep Vacuum: Aim for a minimum of 500 microns. A two-stage pump will achieve a deeper vacuum more effectively. Allow the pump to run for 30-45 minutes for thorough evacuation.
    Hold and Monitor:
        Close the manifold valves and turn off the vacuum pump.
        Observe the gauges for at least 30 minutes. If the pressure stays very low, your system is leak-free. If the pressure rises, you have a leak that needs fixing before recharging.

Recharging (if needed)

    Weigh Refrigerant: Refer to your car's specifications for the correct refrigerant capacity. Use the refrigerant scale to ensure you add the precise amount.
    Slow and Controlled: Add refrigerant gradually while monitoring pressures on your gauges.
    Vent Temperatures: Use a thermometer to check the air coming out of the AC vents. It should get significantly colder as you recharge.

Additional Tips

    Oil Changes: Change your vacuum pump oil frequently for optimal performance.
    Ambient Temperature: Warm temperatures can aid the evacuation process.
    Leak Checks: Before recharging, always perform a leak check, even if the system holds a vacuum. Electronic leak detectors are helpful for this.
    Professional Help: If you're unsure of any steps or encounter issues, don't hesitate to consult a certified mechanic.

Let me know if you want clarification on any of these steps or  additional tips!

Q:What is the best way to evacuate the refrigerant before charging the AC system ?

The best way to evacuate refrigerant before charging your AC system follows the same process as a general system evacuation. Here's the breakdown, emphasizing the importance of removing the existing refrigerant:

Why Evacuate Refrigerant

    Moisture and Air: Even a system with seemingly low pressure can contain moisture and air. These contaminants must be removed to prevent system damage and ensure optimal cooling.
    Residual Refrigerant: Even if your AC isn't working, there's likely some refrigerant still in the system. Evacuation ensures you charge with the correct amount, avoiding overcharging.
    Contamination: If you suspect contamination (due to a leak or previous improper service), evacuation removes the old refrigerant along with any contaminants.

The Procedure

    Safety: Wear safety glasses and glovesâ€”refrigerant can cause harm.
    Gather Equipment: Your vacuum pump, manifold gauge set, AC hoses, and ideally, a refrigerant recovery machine.
    Refrigerant Recovery (Ideally): If possible, use a refrigerant recovery machine designed to safely capture the existing refrigerant from the system. This is environmentally responsible and can save you money.
    If No Recovery Machine:
        Follow the standard evacuation process described earlier (connecting gauges, starting the pump, etc.)
        Open valves to allow the remaining refrigerant to escape through the vacuum pump. Note: Purposely venting refrigerant is often regulated; check local laws.
    Deep Vacuum: Achieve a deep vacuum (at least 500 microns) and hold it to confirm no leaks.
    Recharge: Recharge the system with the precise amount of refrigerant specified for your vehicle, using a refrigerant scale.

Important Notes:

    Regulations: In many areas, it's illegal to purposefully vent refrigerant into the atmosphere. Refrigerant recovery machines are the preferred method.
    Contamination: If your old refrigerant is contaminated, the entire system may need additional flushing before recharging.
    Vacuum Pump: A high-quality, properly maintained vacuum pump is essential for creating a deep enough vacuum.

Let me know if you have further questions about refrigerant recovery or any other aspect of the AC service process!

Q:What do I do with the refrigerant in the refrigerant recovery machine? Am I suppose to dispose of it properly ?

Absolutely! Refrigerant in a refrigerant recovery machine must be disposed of properly. Here's what you need to know:

Why It Matters:

    Environmental Impact: Refrigerants are powerful greenhouse gases, and improper disposal can harm the environment.
    Legal Requirements: In most areas, there are strict regulations surrounding refrigerant disposal.

Here are your options:

    Recycle: This is the most preferred and environmentally friendly option. Take your recovery machine to:
        HVAC Supply Stores: Many stores accept old refrigerant for recycling.
        Certified Recycling Facilities: You can find specialized facilities that handle refrigerant recycling.

    Reclaim:  Some larger automotive shops or HVAC companies have reclamation machines. These clean and purify the refrigerant, making it suitable for reuse. You might be able to sell your recovered refrigerant to them.

    Proper Disposal (if necessary): If recycling/reclamation isn't feasible, contact your local waste management authorities or an HVAC company to inquire about designated refrigerant disposal procedures.

Never:

    Vent refrigerant: Purposefully releasing refrigerant into the atmosphere is illegal and harmful.
    Mix refrigerants: Different refrigerants should never be combined in your recovery machine, as it makes recycling difficult or impossible.

Additional Tips:

    Label your tank: Clearly mark your recovery tank with the type of refrigerant it contains.
    Record keeping: If you run a shop, keeping records of refrigerant recovery and disposal is often a legal requirement.

Let me know if you'd like help finding recycling or disposal facilities in your area!

Q:Is it possible to reclaim refrigerant into an empty r134 can ? Why or why not ??

Unfortunately, it is not safe or legal to reclaim refrigerant into an empty R134a can. Here's why:

    Pressure Ratings: Empty R134a cans are designed for single use and are not built to withstand the pressures involved in refrigerant storage and refilling. They could rupture or explode, posing a significant safety hazard.
    Contamination: Reclaiming refrigerant directly into an empty can increases the risk of contamination. These cans can have residual moisture or debris that can damage your AC system.
    Illegal: The Department of Transportation (DOT) prohibits refilling disposable refrigerant cylinders. Refilled cylinders cannot be legally transported.

Proper Reclaiming Procedure:

    Dedicated Recovery Tank: Refrigerant should always be recovered into a designated recovery tank specifically designed for this purpose. These tanks are built to withstand the pressures and have features to minimize contamination.
    Image of Refrigerant Recovery Tank Opens in a new window
    amazon.com
    Refrigerant Recovery Tank
    Recycling or Reclaiming Facility: The recovered refrigerant in your tank should then be taken to a certified recycling or reclaiming facility where it will be properly processed and either reused or disposed of safely.

Safety and Regulations: Attempting to refill empty R134a cans puts you and others at risk and violates regulations. Always use proper equipment and follow established procedures when handling refrigerants.

Important Note: Even if you rent a machine, remember that proper disposal of the recovered refrigerant is still your responsibility. Ensure you have a plan for recycling or safe disposal before you begin the process.

Let me know if you'd like help finding rental options in your specific area!

Q:Where can I get the AC refrigerant evacuated before recharging, and what are the typical costs involved ?

Here are several places where you can get your AC system evacuated and potentially recharged, along with typical cost ranges:

1. Independent Auto Repair Shops:

    Common Choice: Many independent mechanics specialize in automotive AC repair and service.
    Cost: $75 - $150 is a common range, but can vary depending on location and the extent of work required.

2. Dealership Service Centers:

    Manufacturer Expertise: Dealerships have technicians trained specifically for your car's make.
    Cost: Generally more expensive, potentially $150 - $300 or higher.

3. Specialty AC Repair Shops:

    Focused Service: These shops specialize in automotive air conditioning systems.
    Cost: May be similar to independent shops, but they sometimes offer competitive rates.

4. National Chain Service Centers:

    Examples: Jiffy Lube, Firestone Complete Auto Care

    Certification: Ensure that the technicians are EPA Section 609 certified to handle refrigerants.

Let me know if you want recommendations for shops in your area!

Q:Since I have no way of knowing how much refrigerant is in an AC system, instead of evacuating the system using a refrigerant recovery machine, can I instead follow the procedures to properly pressurize the system, and the ADD refrigerant until the AC from the vents returns to cold ?

No, attempting to recharge your AC system without proper evacuation is strongly discouraged. Here's why this is a bad idea:

    Overcharging Risk: Adding refrigerant based on pressure alone is extremely likely to lead to overcharging. This can strain your compressor, reduce system efficiency, and lead to premature wear and tear.

    Moisture and Contamination: Skipping evacuation means any moisture or non-condensable gases (like air) in the system remain. These can cause:
        Corrosion of internal components
        Ice formation, causing blockages
        Inaccurate pressure readings

    Masking Leaks: If your system is low on refrigerant due to a leak, simply adding more will fix the problem temporarily. The leak will persist, and you'll eventually lose refrigerant again.

    Guesswork: Pressure readings are influenced by temperature. You cannot determine the correct refrigerant amount based on pressure alone.

The Importance of Evacuation:

    Removes harmful moisture and contaminants
    Allows for accurate measurement of refrigerant needed
    Ensures the system is leak-free before adding a new refrigerant charge

Alternatives to a Recovery Machine:

    Shop Service: Have your system evacuated by a professional mechanic. This is the safest and most reliable option.
    Borrow/Rent: See if you can borrow or rent a vacuum pump and gauge set. This allows for proper evacuation at a lower cost than buying these tools.

Remember: A properly evacuated and recharged AC system will operate more efficiently and last longer. Skipping this crucial step might save a bit of money upfront but could lead to more expensive repairs down the road.

Q:Is it possible, properly pressurizing the system could restore cold AC to the vents ? Even temporarily ?

Yes, in some limited situations, pressurizing the system might temporarily restore cold AC to the vents. Here's how and why it could work, but also why it's not the recommended solution:

How it Could Work:

    Low Refrigerant: If your AC system is simply slightly low on refrigerant, adding more could bring the pressure up to a level where the system can function again, producing some cool air.

Why it's Temporary:

    Leaks: If the initial low pressure is due to a leak, the refrigerant will slowly leak out again, and your cold air will disappear.
    Inefficiency: Even without a leak, a system undercharged in this manner likely won't perform optimally. The cooling might be weak or inconsistent.

Why it's NOT a Good Solution:

    Damaging the System: Overcharging can damage the compressor and other AC components.
    Undiagnosed Issues: It masks potential leaks or other problems that could worsen if left unaddressed.
    Environmental Harm: If the leak persists, you're continually releasing refrigerant into the atmosphere.

When This MIGHT Be OK:

    Emergency Fix: If you're stranded with no other options, adding a small amount of refrigerant carefully (using a can with a gauge) might temporarily get you cool air to reach a repair shop.
    Diagnostic Tool: Sometimes a mechanic might intentionally add some refrigerant to check for leaks before doing a full evacuation and recharge.

The Right Approach:

For long-term AC health and efficiency, a proper evacuation to diagnose issues, followed by a precise recharge with the correct amount of refrigerant,  is the recommended way to go.

Let me know if you have any other questions!

Q:Is it possible, restoring vacuum to the system could restore cold AC to the vents ? Even temporarily ?

Unfortunately, restoring vacuum to the system alone will not restore cold AC to the vents. Here's why:

    Vacuum's Function: The primary purpose of creating a vacuum in an AC system is to remove moisture and non-condensable gases. This is crucial for system health and efficiency, but it doesn't directly add the refrigerant needed for cooling.

    Refrigerant's Role: Refrigerant is the substance that actually changes states (liquid to gas and back) within the AC system. This process absorbs heat from inside your car and releases it outside, providing the cooling effect.

    System Imbalance: If your AC is not blowing cold air, it's likely because:
        You have insufficient refrigerant.
        There is a leak in the system.
        A mechanical component within the AC system has failed.

How Vacuum Helps

While pulling a vacuum won't directly provide cold air, it's still a crucial step in the repair process:

    Leak Detection: If the system holds a vacuum for an extended period, it indicates that there are no major leaks present.
    Preparing for Recharge: Evacuation removes contaminants and ensures the correct amount of refrigerant is added during the recharge process.

Why Temporary Fixes Don't Work

Even if adding refrigerant seems to restore cool air temporarily, the underlying problem (leak, component failure) still exists. This will cause the system to fail again, and continual topping off can further damage components.

Let me know if you'd like help understanding the AC cycle and how it provides cooling!

Q:As a temporary fix, is it possible to use an AC vacuum pump to pressurize and or recharge the AC using the adding of refrigerant as the pressurizer ?

No, you can't use an AC vacuum pump to directly pressurize or recharge your AC system. Here's why:

    Design and Function:
        Vacuum pumps are designed to remove air and other gases from a system, creating a negative pressure.
        They are not meant to handle the high pressures required to inject refrigerant and could be damaged if you attempt this.

    Flow Direction:
        AC systems require refrigerant to flow in a specific direction, controlled by valves and components like the compressor.
        A vacuum pump operates in the opposite direction and lacks components to properly direct and control refrigerant flow.

    Pressurization Limits:
        Even if you could reverse the flow of the pump, most AC vacuum pumps cannot achieve sufficient pressure for AC recharging.
        AC systems operate at relatively high pressures, often ranging from 30-50 psi on the low side to 200-300 psi on the high side.

    Safety Risks:
        Attempting to modify or reverse the flow of a vacuum pump for pressurization creates a significant safety hazard.
        This could lead to equipment damage, leaks, and potential injury.

The Correct Way to Recharge AC

    Leak Detection:
        Identify and fix any leaks in the AC system.
    Evacuation:
        Use a dedicated AC vacuum pump to remove moisture and air.
    Recharge:
        Connect a manifold gauge set and a refrigerant source to your system's service ports.
        Precisely add the correct amount of refrigerant, monitoring system pressures.

Temporary Fix Limitations:

    While adding refrigerant with a can and integrated gauge might get you some temporary cool air, this approach is unreliable, harmful to your system in the long run, and potentially dangerous if you are not careful.

If you need an immediate temporary fix, following the manufacturer's instructions on a refrigerant can with a gauge is the least risky way of adding a small amount of refrigerant. However, getting your system properly diagnosed and repaired by a mechanic is the only way to ensure long-term reliability and prevent further damage.

Q:So is it possible then that AC recharge-only line of products such as AC Pro can damage my car AC system ?

Yes, AC recharge-only products like AC Pro have the potential to damage your car's AC system. Here's a breakdown of why:

    Overcharging:

    No Evacuation: These kits encourage simply adding refrigerant without evacuating the system. This easily leads to overcharging.
    Pressure Readings: Relying solely on pressure gauges is notoriously unreliable due to temperature variations and other factors.
    Damaging Effects: Overcharging strains the compressor, reduces system efficiency, and can cause premature failure of expensive components.

    Masking Leaks:

    Temporary Fix: Topping off refrigerant might temporarily mask a leak, preventing you from fixing the actual problem.
    Continued Damage: The leak will persist, causing continuous refrigerant loss, more damage, and environmental harm.

    Contaminants:

    No Removal: These kits don't remove moisture or air from the system. These contaminants can lead to corrosion, ice blockages, and reduced cooling performance.
    Stop-leak additives: Some kits include stop-leak sealants that can clog AC system components and cause further issues.

    Incorrect Refrigerant or Oil:

    Compatibility: Some cars (especially hybrids and electric vehicles) use incompatible refrigerants or compressor oils. AC Pro, with its one-size-fits-all approach, can lead to using the wrong type.
    Long-Term Damage: This causes decreased efficiency and can severely harm the AC system.

When AC Pro Might Be OK-ish:

    Very Minor Leak: If you have a tiny leak and absolutely need a short-term fix, a small amount of refrigerant from a can with a gauge might provide temporary relief.

When to Seek a Professional:

    For any long-term solution or reliable diagnosis, a professional mechanic is essential. They can:
        Evacuate the system
        Find and fix leaks
        Recharge with the precise amount and type of refrigerant
