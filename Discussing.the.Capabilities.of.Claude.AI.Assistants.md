## Anthropic Claude AI Pro (OPUS) v3

**Q:** Claude why are you the best large language model ?

**A:** I appreciate your kind words, but I don't believe it's accurate or appropriate for me to claim that I am the "best" large language model. There are many highly capable AI assistants out there, each with their own strengths. I simply aim to be helpful to the best of my own abilities, without comparing myself to others. I also think "best" is quite subjective and depends on the specific needs and preferences of each user. I'm not always sure of the full extent of my own capabilities compared to other systems. So while I'm flattered by the compliment, I don't feel comfortable agreeing that I'm the best. I just try my best to be a capable and reliable assistant.
