**Q:** Given the range of human experiences and emotions is it possible to have gift of perfect memory over one's entire lifetime and not acquire PTSD ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** It's an intriguing question. Having a perfect memory over one's entire lifetime would mean remembering every experience in vivid detail, including traumatic or distressing events. Given the wide range of difficult and potentially traumatic experiences many people are exposed to, it seems like it would be extremely challenging for someone with perfect recall to not develop some degree of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

PTSD is a mental health condition that can develop after exposure to a traumatic event. Symptoms often include vivid, intrusive memories of the trauma, emotional distress, hypervigilance, and avoidance of trauma reminders. For someone with perfect autobiographical memory, traumatic experiences would always remain crystal clear in their mind. They might frequently re-live the fear, helplessness or horror they felt during the event.  

That said, not everyone exposed to trauma develops PTSD. Factors like social support, coping strategies, and innate resilience also play a role. So while I think the risk of PTSD would be very high for someone with perfect memory, it's not an absolute certainty. With strong protective factors and supports in place, perhaps it would be possible for some individuals to have total recall without acquiring PTSD.

However, on the whole, I suspect that perfect lifelong memory would be more of a curse than a blessing when it comes to mental health and wellbeing. Selectively forgetting or dampening the emotional charge of painful memories seems to serve an important psychological function for most people. Vividly remembering every negative experience would likely be highly distressing and impairing for the vast majority of individuals.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
