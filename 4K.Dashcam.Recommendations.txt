What is a 4k resolution aftermarket dashcam that you would recommend?

ChatGPT:

As of my last training data in September 2021, there were several reputable 4K resolution aftermarket dashcams available on the market. However, technology products evolve quickly, and newer models or brands might have since emerged. That said, here are some highly regarded 4K dashcams from 2021:

    BlackVue DR900S-2CH: This dashcam offers 4K UHD front camera quality, 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, cloud storage options, and more. BlackVue is known for its high-quality cameras and excellent customer service.

    Nextbase 622GW: This is from a UK-based company known for producing high-quality dashcams. It features 4K recording, image stabilization, what3words integration for location sharing, and an Alexa voice assistant.

    Thinkware U1000: This offers both a 4K front camera and a 2K rear camera. Thinkware is known for its advanced parking features and overall reliability.

    Garmin Dash Cam 66W: While not strictly 4K, it offers a wide 180-degree field of view, compact design, and is from a brand well-regarded for its GPS devices.

    VIOFO A129 Pro Duo: It features 4K front camera and 1080p rear camera recording, dual-band Wi-Fi, and budget-friendly pricing for the features offered.

Before purchasing, I'd recommend checking recent reviews, watching sample footage, and considering the specific features you need (e.g., parking mode, GPS, cloud storage). Also, it's a good idea to check for any newer models that might have been released after 2021.
