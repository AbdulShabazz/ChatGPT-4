Q: It would seem 3D Scalable Vector Images would be the desired tessellation modality to perform path tracing and rendering on.

A: You raise an interesting point about using 3D scalable vector images for path tracing and rendering. 3D vector graphics do have some potential advantages in this context:

Scalability - Since vector images are defined mathematically rather than as a grid of pixels, they can theoretically scale to any resolution without losing fidelity. This scalability could be useful for rendering at different levels of detail.

Compact file size - Vector image files are often much smaller than raster image files of comparable detail, since only the mathematical instructions need to be stored rather than color data for every pixel. Smaller file sizes are beneficial for storage and memory efficiency.

Easy editability - The parametric nature of vector images makes them easier to edit and manipulate than raster images. Changing geometry, materials, lighting etc. could potentially be more streamlined.

That said, there are also some significant challenges and limitations to using vector images for path tracing and rendering complex 3D scenes:

Limited detail - While vector images excel at crisp lines and shapes, they struggle with complex organic forms, intricate textures, and other fine details that are more easily captured by high-resolution raster images. Most production path tracers rely heavily on high-res texture maps.

Computational complexity - Calculating intersections and shading on vector-defined geometry can be much more computationally intensive than tracing rays through a raster grid. Vector techniques may not scale well to highly detailed scenes.

Limited adoption - The vast majority of 3D modeling tools, renderers, and asset libraries are raster-centric. Pipelines and ecosystems aren't really set up for an all-vector workflow currently.

Memory usage - While vector image files themselves are compact, the expanded geometry data could end up being quite memory-intensive during the actual rendering process, possibly exceeding raster equivalents.

So in summary, while an interesting avenue to explore, 3D vector graphics likely face an uphill battle in displacing raster-based approaches as the dominant paradigm for production path traced rendering. A hybrid approach using vector data where it makes sense (e.g. for some geometric elements) alongside raster textures and geometry might be a more practical middle ground. Rendering research should definitely continue to explore the potential of vector techniques though! Let me know if you have any other thoughts on this.
