**Q:** How do I disable iPhone camera app in iOS Control Center and the Lock Screen ?

**A:** To disable access to the iPhone camera from the Lock Screen and Control Center, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the "Settings" app on your iPhone.

2. Scroll down and tap on "Face ID & Passcode" (or "Touch ID & Passcode" on older iPhones).

3. Enter your passcode when prompted.

4. Under the "Allow Access When Locked" section, locate the "Camera" option and toggle it off. This will prevent access to the camera from the Lock Screen.

5. To disable the camera from the Control Center, scroll further down on the same page and locate the "Control Center" option under the "Allow Access When Locked" section.

6. Toggle off the "Control Center" option. This will prevent access to the Control Center, including the camera button, from the Lock Screen.

By disabling these options, the camera will no longer be accessible from the Lock Screen or Control Center when your iPhone is locked. The camera app will still be available when your iPhone is unlocked.

It's important to note that disabling the Control Center from the Lock Screen will also prevent access to other Control Center features, such as the flashlight, calculator, and music controls, when the iPhone is locked.
