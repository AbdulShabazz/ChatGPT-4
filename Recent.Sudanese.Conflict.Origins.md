**Q:** Explain the recent Sudanese war and its origins ?

**A:** The recent conflict in Sudan, which escalated in April 2023, stems from deep-rooted political, military, and ethnic tensions within the country. Here's a detailed explanation of the origins and progression of the conflict:

### Historical Background and Context

1. **Colonial Legacy and Post-Independence Turmoil**:
   - Sudan gained independence from Britain and Egypt in 1956. However, the colonial legacy left behind deep ethnic, religious, and regional divisions.
   - The country experienced several civil wars, the most notable being the First and Second Sudanese Civil Wars (1955–1972 and 1983–2005, respectively). These conflicts primarily stemmed from tensions between the Arab-Muslim north and the largely Christian and animist south.

2. **The Darfur Conflict (2003–Present)**:
   - The Darfur region in western Sudan saw a significant conflict starting in 2003. Rebel groups, mostly from non-Arab ethnic groups, accused the central government in Khartoum of neglect and marginalization.
   - The government, under President Omar al-Bashir, responded by arming and supporting Arab militias known as the Janjaweed, leading to widespread violence and accusations of genocide by the international community.

### The 2019 Revolution and its Aftermath

3. **Fall of Omar al-Bashir**:
   - After ruling Sudan for 30 years, Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in April 2019 following months of mass protests against his authoritarian regime.
   - His fall led to the formation of a transitional government comprising both military and civilian leaders, with the goal of steering the country towards democratic elections.

4. **Power Struggles within the Transitional Government**:
   - The transitional government, known as the Sovereign Council, was an uneasy alliance between civilian leaders and the military.
   - Key figures in the military included General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of the Sovereign Council, and General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (known as "Hemedti"), leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a powerful paramilitary group with roots in the Janjaweed militias.
   - Tensions between these military factions and civilian leaders, particularly regarding the timeline for the transition to civilian rule, were a constant source of instability.

5. **October 2021 Military Coup**:
   - In October 2021, General al-Burhan led a military coup, dissolving the transitional government and arresting civilian leaders. This move was widely condemned both domestically and internationally, leading to mass protests and further destabilization.

### The 2023 Conflict

6. **Rising Tensions Between al-Burhan and Hemedti**:
   - Although al-Burhan and Hemedti were allies during the 2021 coup, tensions between them began to rise, particularly over the integration of the RSF into the regular army, a key demand in the transition process.
   - Hemedti, who had amassed considerable power and wealth, was resistant to losing his autonomy, leading to a power struggle with al-Burhan.

7. **Outbreak of Hostilities in April 2023**:
   - In April 2023, these tensions boiled over into open conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by al-Burhan, and the RSF, led by Hemedti.
   - The fighting quickly spread across the country, particularly in the capital Khartoum, as well as in Darfur and other regions. The conflict has led to significant casualties, displacement of civilians, and a worsening humanitarian crisis.

### Key Factors Contributing to the Conflict

8. **Ethnic and Regional Divisions**:
   - Sudan is a diverse country with over 500 ethnic groups. Historical marginalization of certain regions and groups has fueled longstanding grievances that contribute to the ongoing violence.

9. **Economic Crisis**:
   - Sudan’s economy has been in severe decline for years, exacerbated by international sanctions, loss of oil revenue following the secession of South Sudan in 2011, and corruption. The economic hardship has intensified the competition for power and resources.

10. **International Involvement**:
    - Various international actors have been involved in Sudan, either directly or indirectly. Countries like Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Russia have vested interests in Sudan due to its strategic location and resources. Their involvement has often exacerbated tensions rather than fostering stability.

### Current Situation and Humanitarian Impact

11. **Humanitarian Crisis**:
    - The conflict has displaced millions of people, both internally and across borders. There are reports of widespread human rights abuses, including sexual violence, looting, and extrajudicial killings.
    - The healthcare system, already fragile, has been further crippled, leading to a severe shortage of medical supplies and services.

12. **Efforts at Mediation**:
    - Various international and regional bodies, including the United Nations, the African Union, and IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development), have attempted to mediate the conflict. However, ceasefires have been short-lived, and the conflict shows no signs of resolution in the near term.

### Conclusion

The recent Sudanese conflict is rooted in a complex web of historical grievances, power struggles within the military, and deep-seated ethnic and regional divisions. The fighting between the SAF and RSF has plunged the country into a severe humanitarian crisis, with little hope for a quick resolution. The situation continues to evolve, with potential implications for regional stability in the Horn of Africa and beyond.

**Q:** What are the criteria required to recognize Sudan as a failed state, allowing neighboring territories to force an incursion to retake the civil disputed territories ?

**A:** Recognizing a country as a "failed state" and justifying an incursion by neighboring territories or international forces involve complex legal, political, and humanitarian considerations. Here are the key criteria and principles involved:

### 1. **Definition of a Failed State**

A failed state is generally characterized by the following criteria:

- **Loss of Control over Territory**: The central government can no longer exercise control over significant portions of the country's territory, which may fall under the control of non-state actors, militias, or rebel groups.

- **Inability to Provide Public Services**: The state fails to deliver essential services to its population, including security, healthcare, education, and justice.

- **Erosion of Legitimate Authority**: The government loses its legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens and the international community, often due to corruption, lack of effective governance, or violent repression.

- **Economic Collapse**: The state experiences severe economic breakdown, often accompanied by hyperinflation, mass unemployment, and widespread poverty.

- **Humanitarian Crisis**: Widespread human rights abuses, severe food insecurity, mass displacement of people, and other humanitarian catastrophes occur.

### 2. **International Recognition of a Failed State**

International recognition of a state as "failed" usually follows a series of assessments and declarations by international organizations, such as:

- **United Nations (UN)**: The UN may conduct assessments through its agencies, such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), or the UN Security Council. The Security Council can issue resolutions regarding the situation in the country.

- **Regional Bodies**: Organizations like the African Union (AU) or the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) may also recognize a state as failed and call for interventions.

- **International NGOs and Think Tanks**: Entities like the Fund for Peace, which publishes the "Fragile States Index," may label a country as failed based on a variety of indicators.

### 3. **Legal Justifications for Incursion**

Any military incursion or intervention by neighboring states or international forces must adhere to international law, particularly:

- **UN Charter**: Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, except in cases of self-defense or with the approval of the UN Security Council.

- **Responsibility to Protect (R2P)**: This principle allows for international intervention in a state if there is a failure to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, or crimes against humanity. Intervention under R2P typically requires UN Security Council authorization.

- **Regional Security Agreements**: Neighboring states might intervene under regional security agreements, but these interventions should still align with international law and often require UN endorsement.

- **Consent of the Failed State**: In some cases, intervention is justified if the legitimate government of the failed state requests assistance. However, in a failed state scenario, identifying a legitimate government can be challenging.

### 4. **Humanitarian and Ethical Considerations**

Interventions must also consider the following:

- **Humanitarian Imperative**: The primary justification for intervention is often to prevent or mitigate widespread human suffering. Humanitarian corridors, no-fly zones, or peacekeeping missions might be established under this premise.

- **Avoiding Escalation**: Any intervention must aim to stabilize the situation without exacerbating the conflict or causing additional harm to civilians.

- **Post-Intervention Planning**: There must be a clear strategy for post-conflict reconstruction and governance to avoid further destabilization or the creation of a power vacuum.

### 5. **Precedents and Examples**

- **Somalia (1990s–present)**: Somalia is often cited as a classic example of a failed state. The international community, through the UN and African Union, has intervened multiple times to stabilize the situation, with varying degrees of success.

- **Libya (2011)**: The intervention in Libya, authorized by the UN Security Council, was partly justified under the Responsibility to Protect doctrine. The aftermath has led to ongoing instability and questions about the effectiveness of the intervention.

### Conclusion

Recognizing Sudan as a failed state and justifying an incursion would require a thorough assessment by international bodies, likely led by the UN, and a legal framework based on international law, such as the Responsibility to Protect. Any military action would need to be carefully justified, supported by the international community, and aimed at protecting civilians and restoring stability, while avoiding further escalation or long-term instability.

**Q:** What about a paramilitary action outside the legal purview of the U.N. by a nation-state unilaterally taking the territory by force ?

**A:** A unilateral paramilitary action by a nation-state to take territory by force outside the legal purview of the United Nations is generally considered a violation of international law. Such actions are typically condemned by the international community and can lead to severe political, economic, and military consequences for the aggressor nation. Here's a detailed explanation:

### 1. **Violation of the UN Charter**

- **Article 2(4) of the UN Charter**: This article explicitly prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. Any unilateral military action by a state to seize territory from another state without UN authorization would be a direct violation of this principle.

- **Illegal Annexation**: The forcible acquisition of territory is often viewed as an illegal annexation, similar to historical precedents like Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 or Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. These actions were widely condemned and led to international sanctions and, in some cases, military responses.

### 2. **International Reactions and Consequences**

- **Condemnation and Isolation**: The international community, including most sovereign states and international organizations, would likely condemn such an action. The aggressor state could face diplomatic isolation, loss of international legitimacy, and reputational damage.

- **Sanctions and Economic Repercussions**: The UN, individual countries, or regional organizations (e.g., the European Union, African Union) may impose economic sanctions on the aggressor state. These could include trade embargoes, asset freezes, and restrictions on financial transactions.

- **Military and Diplomatic Counteractions**: Other states or coalitions might provide military aid to the state that is being invaded, leading to a wider conflict. In some cases, an international coalition might intervene to repel the aggressor, as seen in the Gulf War following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

### 3. **Legitimacy and Governance Challenges**

- **Governance Issues**: Unilaterally occupying and attempting to govern a disputed territory without international recognition can be extremely challenging. The occupier might face resistance from local populations, insurgency, and civil unrest, making the territory difficult to control.

- **Lack of Legal Recognition**: The international community would likely refuse to recognize any new borders resulting from such an action. This lack of recognition would complicate the aggressor's ability to integrate the territory economically and politically.

### 4. **Humanitarian and Ethical Concerns**

- **Human Rights Violations**: Unilateral military action often leads to significant civilian casualties, displacement, and human rights abuses. The aggressor state could be accused of war crimes or crimes against humanity, further isolating it internationally.

- **Impact on Regional Stability**: Such actions could destabilize the entire region, leading to broader conflict, refugee crises, and humanitarian disasters. Neighboring countries might be drawn into the conflict, either in support of the invaded state or to protect their own interests.

### 5. **Historical Precedents**

- **Russia's Annexation of Crimea (2014)**: Russia's unilateral action in Crimea led to widespread international condemnation, sanctions, and a significant deterioration of relations with the West. The annexation has not been recognized by most of the international community, and the region remains a point of geopolitical tension.

- **Iraq's Invasion of Kuwait (1990)**: Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was met with swift international condemnation and a military response led by a US-led coalition under the auspices of the UN. The action was seen as a blatant violation of international law, leading to Iraq's defeat and severe sanctions.

### 6. **Potential Justifications and Their Limits**

- **Pretext of National Security**: Some states might justify such actions by claiming threats to national security or the protection of their citizens. However, these justifications are often viewed with skepticism and are insufficient to override the principles of state sovereignty and territorial integrity enshrined in international law.

- **Historical Claims or Irredentism**: Some nations may invoke historical claims to justify territorial expansion. However, such arguments rarely gain international acceptance and are generally considered illegitimate under modern international law.

### Conclusion

A unilateral paramilitary action to take territory by force, outside the legal framework of the United Nations, is a grave violation of international law and the principles of state sovereignty. Such an action would likely result in widespread international condemnation, economic sanctions, military counteractions, and long-term instability for the aggressor state. The lack of legal recognition and the potential for severe humanitarian consequences make this approach highly risky and generally unsustainable in the long term.

**Q:** Is this true even in the case of a failed state ?

**A:** Yes, even in the case of a failed state, unilateral paramilitary action by a nation-state to seize territory by force outside the legal purview of the United Nations is still generally considered a violation of international law and can lead to significant consequences. The concept of state sovereignty is a cornerstone of international relations, and the principles of territorial integrity and non-intervention are upheld even when dealing with failed or failing states. Here’s why this remains true:

### 1. **Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity**
   
   - **Inviolability of Borders**: International law strongly emphasizes the inviolability of state borders, regardless of the internal condition of the state. The principle of sovereignty applies to all recognized states, including those considered to be failed or failing.
   
   - **UN Charter**: The United Nations Charter, particularly Article 2(4), prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. This prohibition applies universally, including in cases where a state is experiencing severe internal conflict or governance collapse.

### 2. **International Recognition and Statehood**

   - **Continuity of Statehood**: Even when a state is classified as failed, its legal status as a sovereign entity does not automatically dissolve. The international community generally continues to recognize the state's existing borders and legal personality until a formal change occurs (e.g., through international agreements, UN resolutions, or the emergence of a new recognized government).

   - **Lack of Precedent for Annexation**: There is no accepted legal precedent that permits other states to annex or unilaterally seize territory from a failed state. While internal instability may create power vacuums, it does not legally justify external seizure of territory.

### 3. **Legal and Humanitarian Ramifications**

   - **International Condemnation**: Any attempt to seize territory unilaterally, even in a failed state, would likely lead to broad international condemnation. The action could be labeled as aggression, leading to sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and potential military pushback from other states or international coalitions.
   
   - **Humanitarian Law**: Unilateral military actions often lead to violations of international humanitarian law, particularly if they result in civilian casualties, displacement, and other forms of suffering. The aggressor state could face accusations of war crimes or crimes against humanity.

### 4. **Risk of Wider Conflict**

   - **Regional Destabilization**: A unilateral incursion could lead to further regional instability, drawing neighboring countries into the conflict and potentially sparking broader hostilities. This could result in a protracted conflict with significant human, economic, and political costs.

   - **Creation of Precedents**: Allowing or tolerating unilateral actions in cases of failed states could create dangerous precedents, where states might justify future aggressions under the guise of dealing with failed or unstable neighbors. This could erode the broader framework of international law.

### 5. **Alternatives within International Law**

   - **Humanitarian Intervention with Legal Mandate**: If the situation in a failed state necessitates intervention, this is typically done under a legal mandate from the UN or a regional organization. This might involve peacekeeping missions, humanitarian corridors, or other forms of international assistance designed to stabilize the situation without violating sovereignty.

   - **Responsibility to Protect (R2P)**: In extreme cases where there are mass atrocities, the international community may invoke the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine, which allows for intervention to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity. However, even R2P requires multilateral support and, ideally, a UN Security Council mandate.

### 6. **Historical Examples**

   - **Somalia**: Somalia has been considered a failed state for much of the past three decades. Despite its internal collapse, the international community has not accepted unilateral actions by neighboring states to annex Somali territory. Instead, interventions have been conducted through multilateral frameworks, such as the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).

   - **Libya**: Following the collapse of centralized authority in Libya after 2011, various factions and foreign actors became involved, but outright annexation or seizure of Libyan territory by other states has not been internationally recognized or legitimized.

### Conclusion

Even in the context of a failed state, unilateral paramilitary action to seize territory by force is considered illegal under international law. The principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity remain intact, and any such actions would likely provoke strong international reactions, including sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and potential military countermeasures. The proper course of action in dealing with failed states typically involves multilateral intervention under the auspices of international organizations, rather than unilateral annexation or occupation.

**Q:** What are the criteria to dissolve a failed state ?

**A:** Dissolving a failed state is a complex process that involves both legal and political considerations. The dissolution of a state refers to the complete disintegration of its sovereignty, typically leading to the emergence of new states or the absorption of its territory by neighboring states. Here are the key criteria and processes involved in the dissolution of a failed state:

### 1. **Total Collapse of Central Authority**

- **Complete Breakdown of Governance**: The failed state must experience a complete collapse of central government authority, where no single entity can effectively govern the territory or provide basic public services.
  
- **Widespread Anarchy or Civil War**: The state is engulfed in widespread violence, anarchy, or civil war, where multiple factions or warlords control different regions without any unified leadership.

### 2. **Lack of International Recognition**

- **Loss of International Legitimacy**: The international community may no longer recognize the central government as the legitimate authority over the state's territory. This could happen due to severe human rights violations, inability to control violence, or complete breakdown of civil institutions.

- **Withdrawal of Diplomatic Recognition**: Other countries may withdraw their diplomatic recognition of the failed state's government, signaling that the state no longer functions as a sovereign entity in the international community.

### 3. **Inability to Reconstitute Governance**

- **Failed Attempts at Reconstitution**: There may have been repeated failed attempts to reconstitute a central government through international mediation, peace agreements, or internal processes. This demonstrates that the state is unable to restore its sovereignty or territorial integrity.

- **Persistent Fragmentation**: The state remains fragmented into regions controlled by different factions, ethnic groups, or militias, with no realistic prospect of reunification under a single government.

### 4. **Humanitarian Catastrophe**

- **Mass Displacement and Refugee Crisis**: The failed state experiences a mass exodus of its population due to violence, persecution, or lack of basic services, creating a significant refugee crisis that affects neighboring countries.

- **Severe Human Rights Abuses**: The state's collapse leads to widespread and systematic human rights abuses, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, making it impossible to maintain the state's existing borders and governance structure.

### 5. **Regional and International Consensus**

- **Regional Agreement**: Neighboring states and regional organizations may reach a consensus that the failed state can no longer function as a sovereign entity and must be dissolved to restore stability in the region.

- **International Support**: The international community, including major powers and international organizations like the United Nations, may support the dissolution of the failed state as the only viable solution to end ongoing conflict and humanitarian suffering.

### 6. **Legal and Political Processes**

- **UN Involvement**: The United Nations, often through the Security Council, may play a critical role in the dissolution process by endorsing or mandating the creation of new states, recognizing the change in borders, or administering transitional territories until new governance structures are established.

- **Negotiated Settlements**: The dissolution may occur through negotiated settlements involving all major factions within the failed state, neighboring countries, and international mediators. These negotiations would determine the future of the territory, including possible new states or integration into neighboring states.

- **Referendums and Self-Determination**: In some cases, referendums may be held in different regions of the failed state to determine their future status. This could include decisions on independence, joining a neighboring state, or forming a new autonomous region.

### 7. **Examples and Precedents**

- **Yugoslavia (1990s)**: The dissolution of Yugoslavia in the 1990s is a prominent example. The country broke apart into several independent states following a series of wars and international interventions. The process involved significant international mediation and recognition of new states by the international community.

- **Somalia (1991-Present)**: Although Somalia remains officially recognized as a single state, the northern region of Somaliland declared independence in 1991 and operates as a de facto state, though it is not internationally recognized. Somalia's ongoing fragmentation and the existence of autonomous regions highlight the complexities of state dissolution in practice.

- **Soviet Union (1991)**: The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to the emergence of 15 independent states. This process was largely peaceful and involved legal agreements among the constituent republics, with significant international recognition and support.

### 8. **Post-Dissolution Challenges**

- **Recognition of New States**: Following dissolution, the newly formed states or regions seek international recognition, which can be a challenging and politically sensitive process. Recognition often depends on geopolitical considerations and the legitimacy of new governments.

- **Security and Stability**: Ensuring security and stability in the newly formed states or regions is critical. This may involve international peacekeeping missions, reconstruction efforts, and ongoing diplomatic support.

- **Humanitarian Assistance and Reconstruction**: The international community often plays a vital role in providing humanitarian assistance and supporting the reconstruction of political, economic, and social institutions in the newly formed entities.

### Conclusion

Dissolving a failed state is an extreme measure that occurs only when all other options for reconstituting governance have failed, and the state can no longer function as a sovereign entity. The process typically involves a complete breakdown of central authority, loss of international legitimacy, and a consensus among regional and international actors that dissolution is necessary. The legal and political processes that follow are complex and require careful negotiation, international support, and a focus on ensuring stability and human rights in the aftermath.

**Q:** By damn you've just quoted to me Sudan's qualifications! So why has the territory not yet been dissolved ?

**A:** While Sudan exhibits many characteristics of a failed state, its dissolution has not occurred due to a combination of political, legal, and international factors. Here’s why the territory has not yet been dissolved:

### 1. **International Legal Framework and State Sovereignty**

- **Commitment to Sovereignty**: The international community is generally reluctant to endorse the dissolution of sovereign states, even those that are failing or in a state of collapse. The principle of state sovereignty is a cornerstone of international law, and the international community typically seeks to preserve existing borders and state structures.

- **Complexity of Dissolution**: Dissolving a state involves significant legal and political complexities, including determining the status of the population, the division of resources, and the establishment of new governance structures. The potential for creating new conflicts and instability often deters international actors from pursuing dissolution.

### 2. **Regional Stability Concerns**

- **Risk of Regional Destabilization**: Sudan's dissolution could lead to further destabilization in an already volatile region. The Horn of Africa is characterized by fragile states, ongoing conflicts, and complex ethnic and political divisions. The creation of new states or the redrawing of borders could exacerbate these issues, leading to broader regional conflict.

- **Impact on Neighboring Countries**: Neighboring countries may be concerned about the precedent that Sudan's dissolution could set for their own internal challenges. Many countries in the region, such as Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Eritrea, face their own internal divisions and could be destabilized by a ripple effect from Sudan.

### 3. **International Reluctance to Set a Precedent**

- **Fear of Precedent**: The dissolution of Sudan could set a dangerous precedent for other failing states around the world. The international community is cautious about setting precedents that could encourage secessionist movements or the fragmentation of other states, particularly in regions with complex ethnic and political landscapes.

- **Previous Experiences**: Experiences with the dissolution of states like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union have shown that while dissolution can sometimes be necessary, it often leads to prolonged conflict, humanitarian crises, and significant challenges in establishing stable new states. These experiences make the international community wary of pursuing dissolution as a solution.

### 4. **Ongoing International and Regional Mediation Efforts**

- **Mediation and Peace Efforts**: The international community, including the United Nations, African Union, and regional organizations like IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development), continues to pursue diplomatic solutions to Sudan's crisis. The focus is often on negotiating power-sharing agreements, ceasefires, and frameworks for political transition, rather than dissolution.

- **Support for Transitional Governments**: There is often international support for transitional governments or peace processes that aim to reunify the country or at least stabilize it temporarily. The hope is that through negotiation and international pressure, a more stable and unified Sudan can be re-established.

### 5. **Humanitarian Considerations**

- **Humanitarian Crisis**: Sudan is already experiencing a severe humanitarian crisis, with millions displaced, food insecurity, and widespread violence. Dissolution could exacerbate these conditions, leading to even greater suffering for the civilian population. International actors may be concerned that dissolution would make it harder to deliver aid and protect human rights.

- **Responsibility to Protect (R2P)**: While the Responsibility to Protect doctrine exists to prevent atrocities, its application typically involves intervention to stabilize, not dissolve, a state. The international focus often remains on mitigating the immediate humanitarian crisis rather than fundamentally altering the state’s structure.

### 6. **Internal Divisions and Resistance**

- **Internal Resistance to Dissolution**: Within Sudan, various factions, including the military, paramilitary groups like the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), and some political entities, may oppose dissolution because they benefit from maintaining the current structure, even in its failed state. These groups may prefer to maintain control over portions of the country rather than face the uncertainty of dissolution.

- **Ethnic and Regional Complications**: Sudan’s ethnic and regional diversity complicates any potential dissolution. Any move toward dissolution would have to address the complex interests and identities of these groups, which could lead to further conflict and division rather than a peaceful resolution.

### 7. **Global Geopolitical Considerations**

- **Geopolitical Interests**: Various international powers have strategic interests in Sudan, including access to resources, military alliances, and influence in the region. These powers may prefer a controlled, albeit fragile, Sudan rather than a dissolution that could lead to unpredictable outcomes and a power vacuum that might be filled by rivals.

- **International Strategic Interests**: Countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and even Russia and China have strategic interests in Sudan, particularly concerning its Red Sea access and natural resources. These countries might prefer a unified Sudan, even if weak, to avoid a potentially hostile or unpredictable new state emerging from dissolution.

### Conclusion

While Sudan exhibits many characteristics of a failed state, its dissolution has not occurred due to the international community's commitment to preserving state sovereignty, concerns about regional stability, the complexities of dissolution, ongoing mediation efforts, and the geopolitical interests of various international actors. The focus remains on finding a solution that stabilizes Sudan within its current borders, despite the significant challenges this presents. The dissolution of a state is an extreme measure, often viewed as a last resort, and the international community typically exhausts all other options before considering it.

**Q:** What failed state(s) in recent history which were not mineral rich have been allowed to be dissolved ?

**A:** In recent history, the dissolution of states that are not particularly rich in minerals or natural resources has been relatively rare. Most examples of state dissolution are driven by complex factors, including ethnic conflict, political collapse, and international intervention, rather than a lack of mineral wealth. However, there are some cases where states have effectively dissolved, or regions have seceded, in situations where natural resources were not the primary factor:

### 1. **Yugoslavia (1990s)**
   - **Background**: Yugoslavia, a socialist federation composed of six republics, began to dissolve in the early 1990s due to a combination of ethnic tensions, nationalist movements, and the weakening of the central government after the death of Josip Broz Tito.
   - **Dissolution**: The dissolution led to the creation of several independent countries: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia (now North Macedonia), Montenegro, and Serbia. The wars that accompanied this dissolution, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, were marked by ethnic cleansing and severe human rights abuses.
   - **Mineral Wealth**: Yugoslavia's dissolution was not primarily driven by the presence or absence of significant mineral wealth. While some regions had resources like coal and bauxite, these were not central to the conflicts. The dissolution was largely the result of ethnic nationalism, political fragmentation, and the collapse of centralized authority.

### 2. **Czechoslovakia (1993)**
   - **Background**: Czechoslovakia was a country in Central Europe that peacefully dissolved into two independent states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, on January 1, 1993. This event is often referred to as the "Velvet Divorce."
   - **Dissolution**: The split was driven by rising nationalist sentiments in both the Czech and Slovak regions, differing political and economic interests, and a mutual agreement between the leadership of the two regions. The dissolution was peaceful and negotiated, with both new states quickly gaining international recognition.
   - **Mineral Wealth**: Czechoslovakia was not particularly rich in mineral resources. The dissolution was more a result of political and cultural differences than economic factors, and both new states continued to develop independently without significant reliance on natural resources.

### 3. **Soviet Union (1991)**
   - **Background**: The Soviet Union, a vast multi-ethnic empire, dissolved in December 1991, leading to the emergence of 15 independent republics. The dissolution was precipitated by economic decline, political unrest, nationalist movements, and the weakening of central authority under Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms.
   - **Dissolution**: The dissolution was largely peaceful in many parts of the former Soviet Union, though some regions, such as the Caucasus and Central Asia, experienced conflicts. The Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), which were not particularly rich in minerals, were among the first to declare independence and were quickly recognized internationally.
   - **Mineral Wealth**: While some former Soviet republics, like Russia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan, are rich in minerals and energy resources, many of the newly independent states (e.g., the Baltic states, Armenia, Georgia) have limited natural resources. The dissolution was driven more by political, ethnic, and economic factors than by resource wealth.

### 4. **Eritrea (1993)**
   - **Background**: Eritrea, formerly a part of Ethiopia, fought a long war for independence that began in the early 1960s and ended with Eritrea's de facto independence in 1991 and de jure independence in 1993 after a UN-supervised referendum.
   - **Dissolution**: Eritrea's separation from Ethiopia was the result of decades of armed struggle, primarily driven by issues of national identity, political autonomy, and resistance to Ethiopian control. Eritrea's independence was recognized internationally, and it became a sovereign state.
   - **Mineral Wealth**: At the time of independence, Eritrea was not considered particularly rich in minerals or natural resources. The conflict and subsequent dissolution were motivated by nationalist and political factors rather than resource competition.

### Conclusion

The dissolution of states that are not rich in minerals is often driven by political, ethnic, and social factors rather than economic considerations. Cases like Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Eritrea demonstrate that state dissolution can occur due to a combination of internal conflicts, nationalist movements, and the collapse of central authority, irrespective of the presence of significant mineral wealth. These examples illustrate that the fragmentation of states can be the result of complex historical and geopolitical processes rather than simply resource-based conflicts.

**Q:** So Sudan is being bled of its resources by outside parties whom can rely on local bands for security enforcement instead of more financially intensive methods of defense required by territories in recognized nation-states ?

**A:** The situation in Sudan, particularly in the context of its ongoing conflict and state fragility, does involve external actors exploiting the country’s resources, often with the complicity or support of local armed groups. This dynamic is indeed common in failed or failing states, where the central government lacks the capacity to enforce control over its territory, leading to a situation where non-state actors, militias, and external powers can operate with relative impunity.

### Key Aspects of Resource Exploitation in Sudan

1. **Fragmented Authority and Control**
   - **Lack of Centralized Control**: The Sudanese government has struggled to maintain centralized control over the country, particularly in regions like Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile. This has created a power vacuum that local militias, paramilitary groups, and external actors have exploited.
   - **Militia and Paramilitary Control**: Groups like the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which evolved from the Janjaweed militias, control significant parts of the country. These groups often operate independently or semi-independently from the central government and have their own economic interests, including the exploitation of natural resources.

2. **Resource Extraction by Local and External Actors**
   - **Gold Mining**: Sudan is rich in gold, and much of the country’s gold production is controlled by various militias and paramilitary groups. These groups often sell gold on the black market or through unofficial channels, with profits benefiting local warlords and their external backers.
   - **Oil Resources**: Although much of Sudan’s oil reserves were lost to South Sudan after its secession in 2011, there are still significant oil resources in the country. These resources have been a focal point of conflict and are sometimes controlled by local factions or foreign companies operating under dubious arrangements.
   - **Land and Agriculture**: In addition to minerals, Sudan’s fertile land has been a target for exploitation. Large tracts of land have been leased to foreign entities, particularly from Gulf countries, for agricultural production. These arrangements often bypass local communities and benefit the elites and foreign investors, contributing to further instability and marginalization.

3. **External Involvement and Support**
   - **Foreign Interests and Backing**: Several countries have vested interests in Sudan’s resources, including Gulf states (e.g., UAE, Saudi Arabia), China, and Russia. These countries often support local factions or militias, either directly or indirectly, in exchange for access to resources.
   - **Arms and Military Support**: External actors may provide arms, training, or other forms of support to local militias and paramilitary groups to secure their interests. This further destabilizes the region and entrenches the power of these groups over resource-rich areas.

4. **Reduced Costs of Operation**
   - **Low-Cost Security Enforcement**: In a failed or failing state, external actors can rely on local militias or paramilitary groups for security rather than deploying their own forces, significantly reducing the financial costs and risks associated with direct intervention. These local groups, familiar with the terrain and local dynamics, can enforce security and control with fewer resources.
   - **Avoidance of International Scrutiny**: By operating through local proxies, external actors can avoid direct international scrutiny or condemnation, as their involvement is less visible and less likely to attract attention from global governance bodies like the United Nations.

### Broader Implications

- **Entrenchment of Conflict**: The involvement of external actors and the exploitation of resources by local militias contribute to the perpetuation of conflict. These groups have little incentive to seek peace when they benefit from the ongoing instability and resource extraction.
- **Humanitarian Impact**: The focus on resource extraction over governance and development exacerbates the humanitarian crisis in Sudan. Local populations often suffer from violence, displacement, and environmental degradation as a result of uncontrolled resource exploitation.
- **Weakening of National Institutions**: The reliance on local militias and external actors weakens national institutions and undermines any efforts to rebuild a cohesive state. This creates a vicious cycle where the lack of central authority perpetuates instability, which in turn facilitates further exploitation.

### Conclusion

Sudan’s situation reflects a broader pattern seen in other failed or fragile states, where external actors exploit natural resources with the help of local militias, bypassing the need for more costly and complex state-based governance and defense structures. This dynamic contributes to the ongoing instability and suffering in the country, as local and external actors prioritize resource extraction over the well-being of the population and the development of the state. The international community’s ability to intervene or regulate these activities is often limited, further entrenching the exploitation and conflict.
