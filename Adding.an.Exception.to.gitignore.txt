Adding an exception to a `.gitignore` file for a subfolder in an otherwise excluded directory can be done by following these steps:

**1. Identify the directory and subfolder:**

- **Directory:** This is the directory you want to exclude from being tracked by Git.
- **Subfolder:** This is the subfolder within the excluded directory that you want Git to track.

**2. Open your `.gitignore` file:**

- You can find the `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your Git repository.
- If the file doesn't exist, you can create a new one.

**3. Add the exception rule:**

- Use the `!` prefix to negate the exclusion rule for the subfolder.
- The format for the exception rule is: `!<directory>/<subfolder>`.

**Here's an example:**

```
# Exclude everything in the "build" directory
build/*

# But include the "logs" subfolder within the "build" directory
!build/logs
```

In this example, the `build/*` line excludes all files and subfolders within the `build` directory. However, the `!build/logs` line negates the exclusion rule for the `logs` subfolder, allowing Git to track the files within it.

**Here are some additional points to remember:**

- You can use wildcards to match multiple subfolders. For example, the rule `!build/*/*.log` will include all files with the `.log` extension within any subfolder of the `build` directory.
- The order of the rules in your `.gitignore` file is important. Later rules can override earlier rules. Therefore, make sure your exception rule comes after the rule that excludes the directory.
- You can add multiple exception rules for different subfolders.
