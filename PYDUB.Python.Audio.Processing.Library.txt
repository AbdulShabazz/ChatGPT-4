The most robust Python library for playback of MP3, WAV, and FLAC audio files is **pydub**. It is a cross-platform library that uses the PortAudio library for playback. pydub supports a wide range of audio formats, including MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, and AAC. It also provides a variety of features for working with audio, such as trimming, splicing, and adding effects.

To install pydub, you can use the following command:

```
pip install pydub
```

Once pydub is installed, you can play an audio file using the following code:

```python
import pydub

# Load the audio file
sound = AudioSegment.from_mp3("my_song.mp3")

# Play the audio file
sound.play()
```

pydub also allows you to control the playback of the audio file, such as pausing, stopping, and seeking to a specific position. You can also use pydub to mix multiple audio files together.

Here is an example of how to use pydub to mix two audio files together:

```python
import pydub

# Load the first audio file
sound1 = AudioSegment.from_mp3("my_song1.mp3")

# Load the second audio file
sound2 = AudioSegment.from_mp3("my_song2.mp3")

# Mix the two audio files together
mixed_sound = sound1.overlay(sound2)

# Play the mixed audio file
mixed_sound.play()
```

pydub is a powerful and versatile library for working with audio in Python. It is a good choice for playing audio files, as well as for more advanced tasks such as audio editing and mixing.
