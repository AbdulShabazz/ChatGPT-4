**Q:** What are the get-, set-, etc performance characteristics for Javascript Set, Map, and hash dictionary built in types, displayed in table form ?

**A:** Here is a detailed comparison of the performance characteristics for JavaScript `Set`, `Map`, and standard object-based hash dictionaries (using objects as dictionaries) for common operations. The performance is typically analyzed in terms of time complexity. Note that these complexities are theoretical and actual performance can vary based on the JavaScript engine implementation.

| Operation      | JavaScript `Set` | JavaScript `Map` | Object (Hash Dictionary) |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Insert (add)   | O(1)             | O(1)             | O(1)                     |
| Delete (remove)| O(1)             | O(1)             | O(1)                     |
| Search (has)   | O(1)             | O(1)             | O(1)                     |
| Access (get)   | N/A              | O(1)             | O(1)                     |
| Size (length)  | O(1)             | O(1)             | O(n)                     |
| Iteration      | O(n)             | O(n)             | O(n)                     |

### Explanation:

- **Insert (add)**:
  - **Set**: Adding an element to a `Set` is generally O(1) since it uses a hash internally.
  - **Map**: Inserting a key-value pair into a `Map` is also O(1) because it uses a hash table.
  - **Object**: Adding a key-value pair to an object (used as a dictionary) is O(1) since JavaScript objects use hash tables.

- **Delete (remove)**:
  - **Set**: Removing an element from a `Set` is O(1) due to the underlying hash table.
  - **Map**: Removing a key-value pair from a `Map` is O(1) for the same reason.
  - **Object**: Deleting a key from an object is O(1).

- **Search (has)**:
  - **Set**: Checking if a `Set` contains an element is O(1).
  - **Map**: Checking if a `Map` contains a key is O(1).
  - **Object**: Checking if an object contains a key is O(1).

- **Access (get)**:
  - **Set**: Not applicable since `Set` does not have key-value pairs.
  - **Map**: Accessing a value by its key in a `Map` is O(1).
  - **Object**: Accessing a value by its key in an object is O(1).

- **Size (length)**:
  - **Set**: Getting the size of a `Set` is O(1) since it maintains a count.
  - **Map**: Getting the size of a `Map` is O(1) for the same reason.
  - **Object**: Calculating the number of keys in an object is O(n), where n is the number of keys, because it requires iterating through all keys.

- **Iteration**:
  - **Set**: Iterating through all elements in a `Set` is O(n).
  - **Map**: Iterating through all key-value pairs in a `Map` is O(n).
  - **Object**: Iterating through all key-value pairs in an object is O(n).

These performance characteristics make `Set` and `Map` preferable for use cases where frequent insertions, deletions, and lookups are required. Objects can be more versatile due to their general nature but might not be as performant for large-scale data management compared to `Set` and `Map`.
