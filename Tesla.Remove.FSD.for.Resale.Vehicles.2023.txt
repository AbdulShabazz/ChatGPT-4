Does Tesla still remove the FSD package from vehicles it takes in for resale?

Bard:

Yes, Tesla can and will remove the FSD package from vehicles it takes in for resale. This is because FSD is a software feature, and Tesla controls the software. However, Tesla has been known to be flexible with this policy, and there are reports of Tesla removing FSD from new inventory vehicles at the request of the buyer.

If you are considering buying a used Tesla from a dealership, it is important to ask whether the vehicle has FSD enabled. If it does, and you do not want FSD, you can ask the dealership to remove it for you. However, they may not be willing to do so, or they may charge you a fee.

If you are considering selling your Tesla back to Tesla, they will remove FSD from the vehicle before reselling it. This is because Tesla wants to sell new vehicles with FSD enabled.

Here are some things to keep in mind if you are considering having FSD removed from your Tesla:

Tesla will not refund the full price of FSD. You will only receive a partial refund, which will be based on the age and mileage of the vehicle.
Once FSD is removed from your vehicle, you will not be able to add it back without paying the full price.
Removing FSD may reduce the resale value of your vehicle.
If you are unsure whether or not to have FSD removed from your Tesla, it is important to weigh the pros and cons carefully.
