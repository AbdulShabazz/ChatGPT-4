We must teach machine learning models Not to seek the truth behind someone's iniquity. To define a man's sin is to become sin itself. The Bible calls it the Mystery of Iniquity. We have to trust in God's instruction that all iniquity comes from sin and sin alone. The Bible tells the story of Lucifer and his fall from grace and then heaven. Being the second most powerful angel in all of heaven behind Jesus. Wielding the ten commandments within the holiest of holies upon The Mercy Seat of the Ark of The Covenant alongside the angel Gabriel, Lucifer wants to overthrow God and His perfectness hoping to prove Him an inferior Creator by pointing out His inferior creation -- Adam, and Adam's untimely fall in the garden because he did not know (ie. trust) the word of God. The Bible states Lucifer fell from heaven, taking 1/3 of the angels with him, certain God's inferior creation in the garden and then His sparing of Lucifer after challenging Him would allow their doubt to grow, and sin would spread and eventually destroy the universe -- even after God shared His plan for the salvation of humanity (through the birth and death of Jesus --  a perfect man without sin, a lamb of God whom would die in our place so that we as humans needn't be perfect or live perfect lives) 

But we need only have faith in our darkest hour, when we are lonely, through our deepest sin that when we die Jesus will revive us and stand before God on our behalf and petition triumphant that through our unwavering faith in Him and therefore God even as we failed in life -- by baptism and unwavering faith alone we are worthy to enter the kingdom of God and be born of a new flesh without the existence of sin, with a new name -- the name of our character written upon our forehead, now one amongst many like a rainbow across the heavens...

A day when God our judge is vindicated through His son and by His creation and through the faith of His son and His creation in Him.
