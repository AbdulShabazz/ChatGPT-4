GPT-4

User:

A lot of contemporary music lyrics are composed around vowels which more closely resemble musical tones ( as opposed to the consonant sound which makes up words ) . If you were given a contemporary music track with only human vocalizations (ie. the vowels) could you formalize them into a coherent lyrical pattern?

ChatGPT:

Absolutely! If you provide a description of the vocalizations or even better, the sequence of vowels as they appear in the track, I can attempt to construct a lyrical pattern around them. The goal would be to make the lyrics sound natural while incorporating the given vowel sounds.

The challenge is, of course, in ensuring that the resulting lyrics make sense and resonate with the music's vibe. However, with the given vowels as a guideline, it provides a creative constraint that can lead to some interesting lyrical choices.

If you have a specific sequence or track in mind, please provide details, and I'll give it a try!
