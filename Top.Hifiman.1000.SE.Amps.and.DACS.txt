Notes: 

The Jotunheim 2 is a desktop DAC/amp combo unit that is designed to power high-end headphones. It has a frequency response of 10Hz to 90kHz, which is wider than the audible frequency range and well beyond the frequency response of the HE1000SE. The Jotunheim 2 also has a powerful output of 4.75W per channel at 32 ohms, which is more than enough power to drive the HE1000SE to high levels.

Other premium DAC/amp combo units that are compatible with the HE1000SE include the following:

Burson Audio Conductor 3X GT
iFi audio Pro iCAN Signature
Chord Electronics Mojo 2
Linear Tube Audio MicroZotl 2
