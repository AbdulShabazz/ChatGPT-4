There are many reasons why fingernails might yellow. Here are a few of the most common:

* **Nail polish:** This is a common culprit, especially if you wear dark or brightly colored polishes often. The chemicals in the polish can stain the nail plate over time.
* **Smoking:** Smoking can stain your teeth, fingers, and yes, even your nails. The tar and nicotine in cigarettes can build up under the nail plate and cause it to yellow.
* **Fungal infections:** A fungal infection of the nail, also known as onychomycosis, can cause the nail to thicken, crumble, and turn yellow. This is a more serious condition that requires medical treatment.
* **Psoriasis:** This is a skin condition that can affect the nails, causing them to pit, thicken, and turn yellow.
* **Medications:** Certain medications, such as antibiotics, antimalarials, and diuretics, can have the side effect of yellowing nails.
* **Trauma:** Injuring your nail can cause it to bruise and turn yellow. This is usually temporary and the nail will eventually grow out normally.
* **Vitamin deficiencies:** Deficiencies in vitamins B12, C, or E can sometimes cause yellow nails.

If you're concerned about the yellowing of your nails, it's best to see a doctor or dermatologist to rule out any underlying medical conditions. They can also help you determine the best course of treatment.

In the meantime, here are a few things you can do to help keep your nails healthy and prevent them from yellowing:

* **Limit your use of nail polish.** If you must wear polish, choose lighter colors and give your nails a break in between applications.
* **Quit smoking.** This is good for your overall health, not just your nails.
* **Wear gloves when cleaning or using harsh chemicals.** This will help protect your nails from staining and irritation.
* **Eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.** This will provide your nails with the nutrients they need to stay healthy.
* **Take a biotin supplement.** Biotin is a B vitamin that is sometimes helpful for strengthening nails and preventing them from breaking.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
