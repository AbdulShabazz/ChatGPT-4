**Q:** Does the metal band, Syk , employ drum machines ?

**A:** Syk is a metal band known for their experimental and avant-garde sound, and they have indeed used drum machines and electronic drum elements in their music. However, it's worth noting that they also have a human drummer, Alessandro Gobbi, who has been a part of the band since its formation.
Syk's music often features a blend of organic and electronic elements, and they have experimented with various sounds and techniques to create a unique sonic landscape. So, while drum machines are certainly part of their sound, they are not the sole source of percussion in their music.
If you're interested in learning more about Syk's music and their use of drum machines, I recommend checking out some of their albums, such as "Vegalia" or "Alpha", which showcase their innovative approach to metal music.
