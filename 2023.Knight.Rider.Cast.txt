If the Knight Rider TV show were made into a feature film who would be the ideal person for the voice of Kit, the car; as well as the lead actor?

ChatGPT:

Casting choices are subjective and depend on the vision of the filmmakers, as well as contemporary popular actors and trends. As of my last update in 2021, some possible suggestions could be:

For K.I.T.T.'s voice:

    Benedict Cumberbatch - His voice has gravitas and sophistication. He's voiced Smaug in "The Hobbit" and Doctor Strange in the Marvel universe.
    Idris Elba - Known for his strong presence and iconic voice.
    James Earl Jones - A classic choice known for voicing Darth Vader. However, his age might be a consideration.

For the lead role of Michael Knight:

    Chris Hemsworth - Has the action-hero look and charisma.
    John Boyega - Proven acting chops from roles like "Star Wars" and has the potential to bring a fresh take on the character.
    Zac Efron - Has the charisma and has diversified his roles in recent years, making him a potential fit.

Again, these choices are subjective, and it depends on the direction filmmakers want to take the story. The movie's tone, whether it's more serious or light-hearted, would also influence these decisions.

I like the choice of Zac Effron and Idris Elba.

ChatGPT:

That's a great combination!

Zac Efron as Michael Knight would bring both charm and physicality to the role. Over the years, he's shown considerable range in his acting, from comedic roles to more dramatic parts. His fan base and familiarity with audiences would also be a bonus.

Idris Elba voicing K.I.T.T. would lend a level of gravitas, authority, and smoothness to the car's personality. Elba's distinct voice is recognizable and charismatic, making it perfect for an AI assistant that's both wise and protective.

Together, the chemistry between Efron's portrayal of Michael and Elba's voice as K.I.T.T. could be a compelling dynamic that would surely draw audiences to the theaters.
