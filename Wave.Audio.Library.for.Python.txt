To encode two stereo sinewave sources, 20Hz and 1kHz, into a .WAV file with a 768kHz PCM sampling rate at 32 bits per sample, the following steps would be taken:

1. **Generate the sinewave signals.** This can be done using a variety of methods, such as generating a lookup table of sinewave values or using a digital signal processing (DSP) library.
2. **Interleave the channels.** The two stereo channels (left and right) need to be interleaved into a single data stream. This is done by alternating between the left and right channel samples.
3. **Quantize the samples.** The 32-bit samples need to be quantized to 16 bits. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as linear quantization or floating-point quantization.
4. **Write the data to a .WAV file.** The interleaved and quantized samples need to be written to a .WAV file. The .WAV file header should be configured for the correct sampling rate and bit depth.

Here is an example of how to encode the two stereo sinewave sources in Python using the NumPy and WAV libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import wave

# Generate the sinewave signals
fs = 768000  # Sampling rate
t = np.arange(0, 1, 1 / fs)  # Time vector

# 20Hz sinewave
f1 = 20
x1 = np.sin(2 * np.pi * f1 * t)

# 1kHz sinewave
f2 = 1000
x2 = np.sin(2 * np.pi * f2 * t)

# Interleave the channels
interleaved = np.vstack((x1, x2)).T

# Quantize the samples
quantized = interleaved.astype(np.int16)

# Write the data to a .WAV file
with wave.open("sinewaves.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.setnchannels(2)
    f.setsampwidth(2)
    f.setframerate(fs)
    f.writeframes(quantized.tobytes())
```

This will create a .WAV file called `sinewaves.wav` that contains the two stereo sinewave sources. The file will have a sampling rate of 768kHz and a bit depth of 16 bits.

Note that this is just a simple example. There are many other ways to encode the sinewave sources into a .WAV file. For example, you could use a different DSP library or a different quantization method. You could also add additional features to the .WAV file, such as a header with metadata.
