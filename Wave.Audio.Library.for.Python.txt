To encode two stereo sinewave sources, 20Hz and 1kHz, into a .WAV file with a 768kHz PCM sampling rate at 32 bits per sample, the following steps would be taken:

1. **Generate the sinewave signals.** This can be done using a variety of methods, such as generating a lookup table of sinewave values or using a digital signal processing (DSP) library.
2. **Interleave the channels.** The two stereo channels (left and right) need to be interleaved into a single data stream. This is done by alternating between the left and right channel samples.
3. **Quantize the samples.** The 32-bit samples need to be quantized to 16 bits. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as linear quantization or floating-point quantization.
4. **Write the data to a .WAV file.** The interleaved and quantized samples need to be written to a .WAV file. The .WAV file header should be configured for the correct sampling rate and bit depth.

Here is an example of how to encode the two stereo sinewave sources in Python using the NumPy and WAV libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import wave

# Generate the sinewave signals
duration = 1
fs = 768000  # Sampling rate
t = np.arange(0, 1, int(fs * duration) )  # Time vector

bps = np.int16 # bit-depth per sample
dynamic_range = 2 ** bps (-32535,32535) @ 16-bit

amplitude_x1 = int(0.6 * dynanic_rang)
amplitude_x2 = int(0.6 * dynamic_range)

# 20Hz sinewave
f1 = 20
x1 = amplitude_x1 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * f1 * t)

# 1kHz sinewave
f2 = 1000
x2 = amplitude_x2 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * f2 * t)

# Interleave the channels
interleaved = np.vstack((x1, x2)).T

# Quantize the samples
quantized = interleaved.astype(bps)

# Write the data to a .WAV file
with wave.open("sinewaves.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.setnchannels(2)
    f.setsampwidth(2)
    f.setframerate(fs)
    f.writeframes(quantized.tobytes())
```

This will create a .WAV file called `sinewaves.wav` that contains the two stereo sinewave sources. The file will have a sampling rate of 768kHz and a bit depth of 16 bits.

Note that this is just a simple example. There are many other ways to encode the sinewave sources into a .WAV file. For example, you could use a different DSP library or a different quantization method. You could also add additional features to the .WAV file, such as a header with metadata.

To install the wave library for Python with pip for Windows, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt window.
2. Type the following command:

```
pip install wave
```

3. Press Enter.

Pip will download and install the wave library. Once the installation is complete, you can import the wave library in your Python scripts.

For example, the following code imports the wave library and reads a .WAV file:

```python
import wave

# Open the .WAV file
with wave.open("sinewaves.wav", "rb") as f:
    # Get the sampling rate and bit depth
    sampling_rate = f.getsampwidth()
    bit_depth = f.getframerate()

    # Read the data from the file
    data = f.readframes(f.getnframes())

# Close the file
f.close()

# Do something with the data
```

If you are using an older version of Python on Windows, you may need to install pip manually. You can download the pip installer from the Python website. Once you have installed pip, you can follow the steps above to install the wave library.
