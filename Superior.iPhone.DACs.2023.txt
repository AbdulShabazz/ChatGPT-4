Yes, there are a few DACs with a frequency response from 6Hz to 65kHz that are priced under $500. Here are a few examples:

* **Topping D30 Pro**
* **SMSL M500 MKII**
* **xDuoo XA-10**
* **FiiO K5 Pro**
* **iFi Zen DAC V2**

These DACs all offer excellent sound quality and a wide frequency response, making them a good choice for audiophiles who are looking for the best possible sound quality.

The Topping D30 Pro is a particularly good choice for those who are looking for a DAC with a wide frequency response. It has a frequency response of 5Hz to 100kHz, which is wider than the frequency response of most other DACs in its price range.

The SMSL M500 MKII is another good choice for those who are looking for a DAC with a wide frequency response. It has a frequency response of 5Hz to 90kHz, which is also wider than the frequency response of most other DACs in its price range.

The xDuoo XA-10 is a good choice for those who are looking for a DAC with a wide frequency response and a warm, analog sound. It has a frequency response of 5Hz to 90kHz and uses vacuum tubes to amplify the audio signal.

The FiiO K5 Pro is a good choice for those who are looking for a DAC with a wide frequency response and a powerful headphone amplifier. It has a frequency response of 10Hz to 50kHz and can output up to 2.5W per channel into 32Î© headphones.

The iFi Zen DAC V2 is a good choice for those who are looking for a DAC with a wide frequency response and a clean, neutral sound. It has a frequency response of 20Hz to 20kHz and uses a Burr-Brown DAC chip to convert the digital audio signal to analog.

Ultimately, the best DAC for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. If you are looking for a DAC with a wide frequency response, then any of the DACs listed above would be a good choice. However, I recommend reading reviews and comparing the features of different DACs before making a purchase.
