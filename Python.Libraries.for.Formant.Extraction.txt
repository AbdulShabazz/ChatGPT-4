There are Python libraries that can be used to extract formants from an audio speech file. Formants are the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract and are key features in speech processing and analysis. Here are some libraries and tools you can consider:

1. **Praat-Parselmouth:**
   - **Description**: Parselmouth is a Python interface to the Praat software, widely used in phonetics and linguistics for analyzing, synthesizing, and manipulating speech.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Access to Praat's powerful speech analysis capabilities.
     - Formant extraction, pitch tracking, intensity analysis.
     - Ability to work with other Python libraries like NumPy.
   - **Installation**: `pip install praat-parselmouth`
   - **Usage Example**:
     ```python
     import parselmouth
     snd = parselmouth.Sound("your_audio_file.wav")
     formants = snd.to_formant_burg()
     ```

2. **LibROSA:**
   - **Description**: A Python package for music and audio analysis. It provides the building blocks necessary to create music information retrieval systems.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Extensive functionality for audio signal processing.
     - Not specifically designed for speech but can be adapted for formant analysis.
   - **Installation**: `pip install librosa`
   - **Usage Note**: Formant extraction in LibROSA might require combining several functions and potentially custom algorithms.

3. **SpeechPy:**
   - **Description**: A library dedicated to speech processing and feature extraction.
   - **Key Features**:
     - MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), which can be related to formants.
     - Easy-to-use interface for speech processing tasks.
   - **Installation**: `pip install speechpy`
   - **Usage Note**: SpeechPy primarily focuses on MFCCs, which can be indicative of formant frequencies but is not a direct method for formant extraction.

4. **Aeneas:**
   - **Description**: Aeneas is an open-source Python library that automatically generates a synchronization map between a list of text fragments and an audio file containing the narration of the text.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Primarily used for text-audio alignment.
     - Can be extended for speech analysis with additional coding.
   - **Installation**: `pip install aeneas`
   - **Usage Note**: While not directly for formant extraction, Aeneas can be a useful tool in speech processing pipelines.

5. **SciPy and NumPy:**
   - **Description**: Fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Powerful array operations, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), and signal processing capabilities.
     - Can be used to implement custom formant extraction algorithms.
   - **Installation**: `pip install numpy scipy`
   - **Usage Note**: Using SciPy and NumPy for formant extraction requires a good understanding of digital signal processing.

6. **PyDub:**
   - **Description**: A high-level audio library that makes it easy to work with audio files in Python.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Simple API for audio manipulation.
     - Can be combined with other libraries for feature extraction.
   - **Installation**: `pip install pydub`
   - **Usage Note**: PyDub is excellent for audio file manipulation but does not provide direct formant extraction functions.

7. **Python_speech_features:**
   - **Description**: This library provides common speech features for ASR including MFCCs and filterbank energies.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Focused on features used in automatic speech recognition.
   - **Installation**: `pip install python_speech_features`
   - **Usage Note**: Similar to SpeechPy, the focus is on MFCCs rather than direct formant extraction.

When selecting a library, consider the specific requirements of your project, such as the complexity of the audio processing tasks, the need for additional speech processing features, and your familiarity with digital signal processing concepts.
