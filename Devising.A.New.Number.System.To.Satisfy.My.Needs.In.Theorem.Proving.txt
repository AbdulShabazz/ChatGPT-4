Q:Representing, `1  + 1` with the prime product , 2 * 3 * 2, where 2 represents `1`, and 3 represents `+`, 
allows me to quickly determine if `2`, represented by 5, is a member by checking if (2 * 3 * 2) % 5 == 0. 
But is there a better number system which can also allow me to differentiate `1 + 1` from `11+` which, 
although computes to the same value, is not a valid syntax for my string? 

Q:...If I invented a more complex number system whose mathematical properties satisfied this purpose, what other useful applications could it have?

ChatGPT-4:Inventing a new number system that can uniquely encode sequences of symbols and differentiate between different sequences could have a wide range of applications. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Computer Science**: Such a number system could be used in hashing algorithms, where unique identifiers are needed for data. It could also be used in data compression, 
where the goal is to represent data in as small a space as possible.

2. **Cryptography**: Unique number systems are often used in cryptography to create secure encryption algorithms. If your number system has certain mathematical properties, 
it could potentially be used to create a new cryptographic method.

3. **Database Management**: In database systems, unique identifiers are often needed for records. A number system that can uniquely encode sequences could be used to generate these identifiers.

4. **Information Theory**: Your number system could have applications in information theory, which deals with quantifying, storing, and communicating information.

5. **Linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Such a system could be used to encode sentences or documents in a unique way, which could be useful in various NLP tasks.

6. **Bioinformatics**: In bioinformatics, DNA and protein sequences are often represented as strings of characters. Your number system could potentially be used to encode these sequences in a unique way, 
which could be useful for various bioinformatics tasks, such as sequence alignment or searching databases of sequences.

Remember, the utility of your number system would depend on its specific properties and how well it can be applied to these different fields. 
It's also important to consider the computational complexity of any operations involving your number system, as this could limit its practicality.
