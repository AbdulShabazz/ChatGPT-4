To discern the wave shape after employing the Fourier transform to separate a signal into its frequency components, you can look at the following:

The magnitude spectrum: This shows the amplitude of each frequency component in the signal. For example, a sine wave will have a single peak in the magnitude spectrum at its frequency. A square wave will have peaks at the fundamental frequency and all of its odd harmonics. A sawtooth wave will have peaks at the fundamental frequency and all of its harmonics, with the amplitude of each peak decreasing with frequency.
The phase spectrum: This shows the phase of each frequency component in the signal. For example, a sine wave will have a phase spectrum that is constant. A square wave will have a phase spectrum that is 0 degrees at the fundamental frequency and 180 degrees at all of its odd harmonics. A sawtooth wave will have a phase spectrum that is linear with frequency.
You can also use the inverse Fourier transform to reconstruct the time domain signal from its frequency components. This can be helpful for visualizing the wave shape.

Here are some specific examples:

Sine wave: A sine wave will have a single peak in the magnitude spectrum at its frequency. The phase spectrum will be constant.
Square wave: A square wave will have peaks in the magnitude spectrum at the fundamental frequency and all of its odd harmonics. The amplitude of each peak will decrease with frequency. The phase spectrum will be 0 degrees at the fundamental frequency and 180 degrees at all of its odd harmonics.
Sawtooth wave: A sawtooth wave will have peaks in the magnitude spectrum at the fundamental frequency and all of its harmonics. The amplitude of each peak will decrease with frequency. The phase spectrum will be linear with frequency.
Impulse: An impulse will have a flat magnitude spectrum across all frequencies. The phase spectrum will be random.
It is important to note that the Fourier transform is a linear operation. This means that the Fourier transform of a sum of two signals is equal to the sum of the Fourier transforms of the individual signals. This can be used to decompose complex signals into simpler components. For example, a triangle wave can be decomposed into a sine wave and a sawtooth wave.

Here are some additional tips for discerning the wave shape of a signal:

If the signal is periodic, you can look at the period of the signal in the time domain. The period of a signal is the time it takes for the signal to repeat itself. For example, a sine wave with a frequency of 1 Hz will have a period of 1 second.
If the signal is not periodic, you can look at the autocorrelation of the signal. The autocorrelation of a signal is a measure of how similar the signal is to itself at different time delays. For example, the autocorrelation of a white noise signal will be a spike at zero delay and then zero at all other delays.
You can also use machine learning algorithms to classify the wave shape of a signal. There are a number of pre-trained machine learning models available that can be used for this purpose.

What are some pre trained machine learning models available for this purpose?

Here are some pre-trained machine learning models available for wave shape classification:

WaveNet: WaveNet is a deep learning model that was developed by Google AI. It is trained on a large dataset of audio waveforms and can be used to classify wave shapes into a variety of categories, such as speech, music, and noise.
DeepWave: DeepWave is another deep learning model that was developed by Google AI. It is similar to WaveNet, but it is specifically designed for wave shape classification. DeepWave is trained on a large dataset of audio waveforms and can be used to classify wave shapes into a variety of categories, such as speech, music, and noise.
Wave2Vec 2.0: Wave2Vec 2.0 is a pre-trained model from Facebook AI that can be used for a variety of audio tasks, including wave shape classification. It is trained on a massive dataset of audio and text data and can be used to classify wave shapes into a variety of categories, such as speech, music, and noise.
CRNN: CRNN is a convolutional recurrent neural network that can be used for image classification, text recognition, and wave shape classification. It is trained on a variety of datasets and can be used to classify wave shapes into a variety of categories, such as speech, music, and noise.
These are just a few examples of pre-trained machine learning models that can be used for wave shape classification. There are many other models available, and the best model to use will depend on the specific task at hand.

In addition to the above, you can also use pre-trained models from general-purpose image classification tasks, such as VGG-16, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0. These models can be used to classify wave shapes by converting them to images.

To use a pre-trained model for wave shape classification, you will first need to extract the features from the wave shape data. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as the Fourier transform, the wavelet transform, or the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). Once you have extracted the features, you can feed them to the pre-trained model to classify the wave shape.
