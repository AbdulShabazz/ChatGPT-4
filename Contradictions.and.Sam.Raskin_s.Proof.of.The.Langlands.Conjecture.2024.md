**Q:** Have discrepancies been found in Sam Raskin's proof to the Langland's Conjecture ?

Based on the provided sources, there are no indications of discrepancies found in Sam Raskin's proof of the Geometric Langlands Conjecture. The sources primarily discuss the collaborative efforts and the main ideas behind the proof, as well as the contributions of various mathematicians involved in the project.

1. The paper titled "Proof of the Geometric Langlands Conjecture V: The Multiplicity One" by D. Gaitsgory and collaborators, including Sam Raskin, outlines the proof and acknowledges the contributions of many mathematicians in the field[1].

2. A YouTube video from May 6, 2024, features Sam Raskin discussing the proof of the unramified, global Geometric Langlands Conjecture, highlighting the joint work with Gaitsgory and others[2][4].

3. Another paper by Sam Raskin, "An Arithmetic Application of Geometric Langlands," provides an overview of the technical background and the arithmetic aspects of the Geometric Langlands Conjecture, without mentioning any discrepancies[3].

4. The document "Geometric Langlands Duality for Periods" also references the proof of the Geometric Langlands Conjecture and acknowledges the collaborative efforts, but does not mention any issues or discrepancies[5].

Overall, the sources emphasize the collaborative nature of the work and the successful proof of the conjecture, without any mention of discrepancies.
