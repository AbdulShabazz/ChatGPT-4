**Q:** For some reason merges from the main branch are not saved and updated following PR from these branches to main .

**A:** When merges from the main branch are not saved and updated following a pull request (PR), several potential issues might be causing this problem. Here are the steps and considerations to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

### 1. **Check PR Merge Status:**
- **Ensure the PR was successfully merged:**
  - Verify that the pull request shows as "Merged" and not "Closed" or "Open" in the repository's pull request section.
- **Check for Merge Conflicts:**
  - If there were conflicts during the merge process, ensure they were resolved correctly before merging.

### 2. **Repository Permissions:**
- **Permissions and Access:**
  - Verify that you have the necessary permissions to merge branches into the main branch.
  - Check if there are any branch protection rules on the main branch that might be preventing the merge.

### 3. **Local Repository Issues:**
- **Update Local Repository:**
  - Ensure your local repository is up-to-date by running:
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git pull origin main
    ```
- **Verify Local Changes:**
  - Confirm that the changes from the merged PR are present in your local main branch.

### 4. **Check for CI/CD Issues:**
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline:**
  - If you are using a CI/CD pipeline, ensure that the pipeline runs successfully and deploys the changes.
  - Check the CI/CD logs for any errors or issues that might be causing the merge not to be reflected.

### 5. **Repository Configuration:**
- **Default Branch:**
  - Verify that the correct branch is set as the default branch in the repository settings.
- **Branch Protection Rules:**
  - Check if there are any branch protection rules that might be affecting the merge process, such as required status checks or review approvals.

### 6. **Version Control System (VCS) Issues:**
- **Check Git Configuration:**
  - Ensure that your Git configuration is set correctly and that you are working with the correct remote repositories.
- **Verify Remote Branches:**
  - List remote branches and ensure the main branch is listed:
    ```bash
    git branch -r
    ```

### 7. **Investigate Specific Commands and Outputs:**
- **Merge Command:**
  - Review the specific commands used to merge branches. For example:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge feature-branch
    ```
- **PR Merge Method:**
  - Check if the PR was merged using a specific method (e.g., "Squash and merge," "Rebase and merge") that might affect how changes are reflected.

### Example Workflow:

1. **Fetch and Merge Main into Feature Branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout feature-branch
    git fetch origin
    git merge origin/main
    ```

2. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
    ```bash
    git status
    # Resolve conflicts in the listed files
    git add .
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
    ```

3. **Push Changes and Create PR:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature-branch
    # Create PR from feature-branch to main
    ```

4. **Merge PR:**
    - Ensure the PR is merged via the repository's interface and confirm the status is "Merged."

5. **Update Local Main Branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the merges from the main branch not to be saved and updated. If the problem persists, further investigation into specific error messages or logs will be necessary.

**Q:** The solution via the web interface was to fork a branch off of the main branch, pull changes from- and or merge with the outside branch whose changes we want to integrate, and then rename the new branch back to the outside branch.

**A:** Using a web interface to fork a branch off the main branch, pull changes, and then rename the branch back to integrate changes can be an effective way to manage merges and resolve conflicts. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Forking a Branch from the Main Branch
- **Create a New Branch from Main:**
  - Navigate to your repository on the web interface.
  - Go to the `main` branch.
  - Create a new branch by clicking on the branch dropdown and entering a new branch name (e.g., `integration-branch`).

#### 2. Pull Changes from the Outside Branch
- **Merge the Outside Branch into the Integration Branch:**
  - Switch to the `integration-branch` you just created.
  - Use the web interface to create a pull request (PR) to merge changes from the outside branch (e.g., `feature-branch`) into the `integration-branch`.

#### 3. Resolve Conflicts (if any)
- **Conflict Resolution:**
  - If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them directly in the web interface.
  - Commit the resolved changes.

#### 4. Rename the Integration Branch to the Outside Branch
- **Delete and Rename Branches:**
  - After merging the changes and resolving conflicts, delete the original `feature-branch` (outside branch).
  - Rename `integration-branch` to `feature-branch` using the web interface.

### Example Workflow in Detail

#### 1. Fork a New Branch
1. Navigate to the `main` branch.
2. Click on the branch dropdown and enter `integration-branch` to create a new branch from `main`.

#### 2. Pull Changes from the Outside Branch
1. Switch to `integration-branch`.
2. Create a PR to merge changes from `feature-branch` into `integration-branch`.

#### 3. Resolve Conflicts
1. Review the PR for any conflicts.
2. Resolve conflicts using the web interfaceâ€™s conflict resolution tool.
3. Commit the changes.

#### 4. Rename the Branch
1. Delete the original `feature-branch`:
   - Navigate to the `branches` section.
   - Find `feature-branch` and delete it.
2. Rename `integration-branch` to `feature-branch`:
   - Navigate to the `branches` section.
   - Find `integration-branch` and rename it to `feature-branch`.

### Additional Considerations
- **Permissions and Access:**
  - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete and rename branches.
- **Branch Protection Rules:**
  - Be aware of any branch protection rules that might prevent branch deletion or renaming.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
  - Update any CI/CD configurations to reflect the new branch names if necessary.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can effectively merge changes from an outside branch into the main branch, resolve conflicts, and maintain a clean branch structure. This method leverages the capabilities of the web interface for branch management and conflict resolution.
