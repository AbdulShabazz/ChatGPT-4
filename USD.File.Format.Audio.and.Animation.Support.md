**Q:** Does the USD game engine file format support audio as well as animation​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Yes, the USD (Universal Scene Description) file format supports both audio and animation in addition to 3D scene data. Some key points about audio and animation in USD:

Animation:
- USD has robust support for encoding animation data, including keyframe animation, procedural animation, and simulation caches.
- Animated properties can include transformations, visibility, shader inputs, etc.
- USD's timeline feature allows representing time-sampled data and supports multiple animation clips.

Audio: 
- USD supports references to audio files via the sdf/audioAPI schema
- Audio can be tied to the USD timeline for synchronization with animation
- However, USD does not directly encode audio data within the USD file itself. The audio files (e.g. WAV, MP3) are stored externally and referenced by the USD file.

So in summary, while USD allows you to reference, position, synchronize and play back audio in a 3D scene or animation, the actual audio data is stored in separate files rather than being embedded directly within the USD file like geometry and animation data is. The USD file serves more as an aggregation layer tying the audio and other assets together into a cohesive scene or experience.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
