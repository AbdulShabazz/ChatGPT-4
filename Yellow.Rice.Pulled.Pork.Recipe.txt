**Yellow rice** would be the best rice flavor to pair with pulled pork, baked beans, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. The combination of sweet and savory flavors in this dish would complement the yellow rice well. Here is a recipe for **Pulled Pork and Baked Bean Jambalaya** that uses yellow rice:

Ingredients:

* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1/2 onion, chopped
* 1 green bell pepper, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
* 1 (15-ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 (15-ounce) can kidney beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 (15-ounce) can corn, drained
* 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained
* 1 (10-ounce) package frozen yellow rice
* 1/2 cup pulled pork
* 1/4 cup molasses
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
* Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
2. Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper (if using) and cook for 1 minute more.
3. Add the black beans, kidney beans, corn, diced tomatoes, and yellow rice to the skillet. Stir to combine.
4. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through.
5. Stir in the pulled pork, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Serve hot.

This recipe is easy to make and can be customized to your liking. For example, you can add other vegetables, such as carrots, celery, or zucchini, to the skillet. You can also adjust the amount of chili powder and cayenne pepper to taste.

**Tips:**

* For a richer flavor, use chicken or beef broth instead of water when cooking the rice.
* If you don't have pulled pork, you can use cooked chicken, ground beef, or sausage instead.
* To make this recipe ahead of time, cook the rice and black beans according to package directions. Let them cool completely, then store them in separate airtight containers in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When you're ready to serve, simply heat up the rice and black beans, then add the other ingredients to the skillet and cook according to the recipe instructions.

Enjoy!
