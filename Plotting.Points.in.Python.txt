Here's a plot of the points \([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\) along the x-axis. Each point is represented by a blue circle, and the y-axis has been hidden since the points are plotted solely along the x-axis.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the points to plot
points = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Plot the points along the x-axis
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 2)) # Making the figure wider to better display the points
plt.plot(points, [0]*len(points), 'bo') # 'bo' creates blue circles at each point
plt.yticks([]) # Hide y-axis ticks
plt.title("Points plotted along the X-axis")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.show()
```
Add gridlines to the plot to make it easier to read...

```python
# Plot the points along the x-axis with gridlines
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 2)) # Making the figure wider to better display the points
plt.plot(points, [0]*len(points), 'bo') # 'bo' creates blue circles at each point
plt.yticks([]) # Hide y-axis ticks
plt.grid(axis='x') # Add gridlines along the x-axis
plt.title("Points plotted along the X-axis with Gridlines")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.show()
```
I've added gridlines along the x-axis for better visualization of the points \([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\) plotted. This helps in easily identifying their positions on the axis.

Adding vertical and horizontal lines...
```python
# Plot the points along the x-axis with vertical and horizontal lines
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 2)) # Making the figure wider to better display the points
plt.plot(points, [0]*len(points), 'bo') # 'bo' creates blue circles at each point

# Add vertical lines for each x position
for x in points:
    plt.axvline(x=x, color='gray', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)

# Add a horizontal line at y=0
plt.axhline(y=0, color='red', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)

plt.yticks([]) # Hide y-axis ticks
plt.grid(axis='x') # Add gridlines along the x-axis
plt.title("Points plotted with Vertical and Horizontal Lines")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.show()
```
Now, I've added both vertical and horizontal lines to the plot. The vertical lines, plotted in gray with a dashed pattern, 
correspond to each x position of the points \([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\). A horizontal line, in red and solid, 
has been added at \(y=0\) to clearly indicate the baseline. This enhances the visualization, 
making it easier to reference the exact positions of the points along the x-axis.
