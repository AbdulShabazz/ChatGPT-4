Developing an offline artificial text-to-speech (TTS) library plugin for Unreal Engine with a focus on synthesis quality suitable for theatrical production is a highly specialized task. Since the output will be in formats like .WAV, .FLAC, .AAC, and your custom .VOICE format for later inclusion in any Unreal Engine project, the development process involves several distinct stages:

1. **Designing the TTS Library**:
   - **Core Functionality**: Focus on the algorithm for high-quality speech synthesis. This might involve advanced techniques like deep learning models, if you aim for state-of-the-art quality.
   - **Output Formats**: Ensure the library can output in the desired formats (.WAV, .FLAC, .AAC, .VOICE).

2. **Development Environment**:
   - Use C++20 for development, as it's compatible with Unreal Engine and offers modern language features.
   - Set up a development environment that allows for efficient testing and debugging of the TTS synthesis process.

3. **Integration with Unreal Engine**:
   - Although the plugin works offline, it should be easily integrable with Unreal Engine projects.
   - Develop a system to import the generated audio files (.VOICE and others) into Unreal Engine smoothly.

4. **Custom File Format Development (.VOICE)**:
   - Design the .VOICE file format to be optimal for Unreal Engine, considering aspects like file size, quality, and ease of use within the engine.
   - Develop tools or utilities within the plugin for converting standard audio files into this custom format.

5. **Quality Focus for Theatrical Production**:
   - Prioritize high-fidelity audio output, suitable for immersive theatrical experiences.
   - Implement advanced audio processing techniques to enhance clarity, tone, and naturalness of the synthesized speech.

6. **User Interface and Accessibility**:
   - Design a user-friendly interface for the offline plugin, allowing users to easily generate and export the audio files.
   - Include detailed documentation and guidelines for using the plugin in theatrical production settings.

7. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Rigorously test the TTS synthesis for different scenarios and voice types to ensure consistent quality.
   - Optimize the library for performance, especially considering the processing requirements of high-quality audio synthesis.

8. **Compliance and Distribution**:
   - Ensure your plugin complies with Unreal Engineâ€™s and other relevant software licensing policies.
   - Plan the distribution method for your plugin, whether it's through the Unreal Engine Marketplace, direct distribution, or another channel.

9. **Support and Updates**:
   - Prepare to offer support for users of your plugin.
   - Plan for future updates, especially in response to Unreal Engine updates or advancements in TTS technology.

This project, given its complexity and specialized nature, will likely require iterative development and extensive testing, particularly to achieve the level of quality necessary for theatrical production. Additionally, staying abreast of the latest advancements in TTS technology and Unreal Engine developments will be crucial for the long-term success and relevance of your plugin.
