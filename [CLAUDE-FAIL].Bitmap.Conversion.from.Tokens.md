Bitmap.Conversion.from.Tokens.md

Claude had difficulty providing correct completions to these prompts. Likely due to the lack of adequate training data required to bolster these stochastic models -- another drawback to such models which do not apply meta reasoning or rules-based learning.

## Anthropic Claude 3.5 (Sonnet, Pro Access)

**Q:** `{ "+": 2n, "1": 1n, "2": 8n, "4": 16n, "=": 4n }`, using this dictionary, I group the following token into 5-bit fields to construct the bitmap. I then convert the binary value to hex and then to base 10 decimal, 
```
1 + 1
00001 00010 00001
000 0100 0100 0001
441h
1089n;

```
Repeat this process for the following tokens,
```
Example 2: 2 + 2
Example 3: 1 + 2 + 1
```

**A:** I understand you'd like me to repeat the process of grouping tokens into 5-bit fields, constructing a bitmap, and converting to hexadecimal and decimal for two more examples. I'll do this step-by-step for each example.

Example 2: 2 + 2

1. Group into 5-bit fields:
   2 + 2
   00010 00010 00010

2. Construct the bitmap:
   000 1000 1000 0010

3. Convert to hexadecimal:
   8 8 2h

4. Convert to decimal:
   2178n

Example 3: 1 + 2 + 1

1. Group into 5-bit fields:
   1 + 2 + 1
   00001 00010 00010 00001

2. Construct the bitmap:
   0000 1000 1000 0100 0001

3. Convert to hexadecimal:
   0 8 8 4 1h

4. Convert to decimal:
   34881n

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Is example 3 correct? Because the token 2 in the expression decodes as 01000 thus 0 1000 thus 08h thus 8n...​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the error in my previous response. Thank you for catching that. Let's correct Example 3:

Example 3: 1 + 2 + 1

1. Group into 5-bit fields (corrected):
   1 + 2 + 1
   00001 01000 00010 00001

2. Construct the bitmap (corrected):
   0000 1010 0000 1000 0001

3. Convert to hexadecimal (corrected):
   0 A 0 8 1h

4. Convert to decimal (corrected):
   41089n

You are correct that the token "2" in the dictionary decodes to 01000 (8n), not 00010. This changes the resulting bitmap, hexadecimal, and decimal values. 

Thank you for pointing this out. It's important to be precise in these conversions, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide the correct information.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** The completion you've provided is incorrect: upon inspection it can be verified there are not atleast 5 ones, one for every token, in the bitfield, 

```
Example 3: 1 + 2 + 1
Group into 5-bit fields: 1 + 2 + 1 = 00001 00010 01000 00010 00001
Construct the bitmap: 0 0001 0001 0010 0000 0100 0001
Convert to hexadecimal: 112041h
Convert to decimal: 1122369n
```

**A:** You're absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for my continued errors. Thank you for providing the correct solution. Let's break down the correct process:

Example 3: 1 + 2 + 1

1. Group into 5-bit fields:
   1 + 2 + 1 =
   00001 00010 01000 00010 00001

2. Construct the bitmap:
   0 0001 0001 0010 0000 0100 0001

3. Convert to hexadecimal:
   112041h

4. Convert to decimal:
   1122369n

You're absolutely correct that there should be at least 5 ones in the bitfield, one for each token. My previous attempts failed to account for all tokens properly.

This correct solution properly represents:
- The "1" token twice (00001)
- The "+" token twice (00010)
- The "2" token once (01000)
- The "=" token once (00100)

Thank you for your patience and for providing the correct solution. It's crucial to be accurate in these conversions, and I appreciate the opportunity to acknowledge and correct my mistakes.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Here are the correct reasoning steps for Example 2, 

```
Example 2: 2 + 2
Group into 5-bit fields: 2 + 2 = 01000 00010 01000
Construct the bitmap: 010 0000 0100 1000
Convert to hexadecimal: 2048h
Convert to decimal: 8264n
```

**A:** Thank you for providing the correct reasoning steps for Example 2. I appreciate you sharing this information. Let's break down the correct process:

Example 2: 2 + 2

1. Group into 5-bit fields:
   2 + 2 =
   01000 00010 01000 00100

2. Construct the bitmap:
   010 0000 0100 1000 0100

3. Convert to hexadecimal:
   20484h

4. Convert to decimal:
   132228n

You're absolutely right about the grouping of 5-bit fields and the initial part of the bitmap construction. However, I noticed that the "=" token (00100) was missing in the provided solution. I've included it in this breakdown to ensure all tokens are accounted for.

This correct solution properly represents:
- The "2" token twice (01000)
- The "+" token once (00010)
- The "=" token once (00100)

Thank you again for providing this correction. It's crucial to be accurate in these conversions, and I appreciate the opportunity to refine our understanding of the process.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Omit "="!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** I apologize for the confusion. You're right - I should have followed your example exactly without adding the "=" token. Let's correct that:

Example 2: 2 + 2

1. Group into 5-bit fields:
   2 + 2
   01000 00010 01000

2. Construct the bitmap:
   010 0000 0100 1000

3. Convert to hexadecimal:
   2048h

4. Convert to decimal:
   8264n

This is indeed correct and matches the solution you provided. Thank you for the clarification. It's important to follow the given instructions precisely, and I appreciate you pointing out the need to omit the "=" token.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
