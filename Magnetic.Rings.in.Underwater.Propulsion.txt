There are a few ways magnetic rings can be used in underwater propulsion. Here's a breakdown of the primary concepts:

**1. Magnetohydrodynamic Propulsion (MHD)**

* **Principle:** MHD drives don't directly use magnetic rings. Instead, they work by passing an electric current through seawater in the presence of a powerful magnetic field.  This interaction (Lorentz force) pushes the water backward, creating thrust.
* **No Moving Parts:** The main advantage of MHD drives is the absence of moving parts like propellers, enhancing efficiency and making the system virtually silent.
* **Challenges:**  This method requires very large amounts of electrical power and strong magnetic fields, making it technologically complex and currently impractical for most applications. 

**2. Magnetic Couplings in Sealed Motors**

* **Principle:**  A magnetic ring helps transmit rotational force inside a sealed motor casing. Here's how:
    * **Two Rings:** One ring magnet is attached to the motor shaft inside the sealed casing. The other ring magnet is outside the casing, attached to an external propeller.
    * **Attraction:** The magnetic forces between the rings cause the outside ring and the propeller to rotate in sync with the internal motor shaft.  
* **Waterproofing:** Since the motor is sealed with no shaft penetrating the housing, water leakage is eliminated. This is  crucial for underwater applications. 
* **Common Use:** This technique is more established and is often found in smaller underwater propulsion devices like ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles).

**3. Electromagnetic Induction (Less Common)**

* **Principle:** This is more specialized. Electromagnetic coils wrapped in  an  underwater housing form a ring shape. By pulsing electricity through the coils in a specific sequence, they can create a traveling magnetic field. This field could interact with a conductive plate  or loop nearby, inducing a current in that object and repelling it to create thrust.
* **Complexity:** Less common than other methods due to complexity and efficiency challenges.

**Important Notes:**

* **Research:**  MHD  and even more specialized electromagnetic propulsion concepts are still frequently the focus of research with hopes of improving their practicality.
* **"Magnetic Ring" ambiguity:** Be sure to specify the exact context you're interested in. The term "magnetic ring" can describe several different components that work differently within an underwater propulsion system.
