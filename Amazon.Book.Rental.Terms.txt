While Amazon used to offer physical textbook rentals, they've shifted to focus on digital textbook rentals. Here's how their digital book rental service works:

**Finding Digital Textbooks to Rent**

1. **Amazon Kindle eTextbooks:** Go to the Kindle eTextbooks section on Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/rentals/b?ie=UTF8&node=17853655011](https://www.amazon.com/rentals/b?ie=UTF8&node=17853655011)).
2. **Search:** Use the search bar to find your desired textbook by title, author, or ISBN.
3. **Check for Rental Option:**  On the product page, look for a rental price offer. If it's available for rent, you'll see the option.

**Renting the Digital Textbook**

1. **Rent Button:** Click the "Rent" button on the product detail page.
2. **1-Click Option:** Use the "Rent now with 1-Click" option for a seamless process.
3. **Due Date:**  Take note of the rental period and the due date before confirming your rental.

**Accessing Your Rented Textbook**

* **Kindle Devices:** Your textbook will be delivered to your Kindle e-reader if you have one.
* **Kindle Cloud Reader:** Access your textbook on any device using the Kindle Cloud Reader ([https://read.amazon.com/](https://read.amazon.com/)). 
* **Kindle Apps:** Use the Kindle app on your computer, tablet, or smartphone to read your book.

**Additional Features and Things to Note**

* **Rental Extensions:** Depending on the textbook, you may be able to extend your rental period if needed.
* **Buy Option:** You can opt to buy the textbook permanently at any point during the rental period. Rental fees paid contribute toward the final purchase price.
* **Availability:** Rental availability and prices can vary. Not all textbooks are offered for rent.
* **US Only:** This service is currently limited to customers with shipping addresses in the United States.
