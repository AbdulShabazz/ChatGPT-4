Adding resonance and a sense of constant "push" to a sound involves manipulating various audio properties and effects. Here's how you can achieve these characteristics in sound production:

### 1. Adding Resonance
Resonance amplifies certain frequencies of a sound and can be achieved through:

- **Equalization (EQ)**: Boost the frequencies where the sound resonates the most. This is often around the fundamental frequency of the sound source or its harmonics.
- **Resonant Filters**: Use filters like band-pass or resonant low/high-pass filters. These filters not only cut or boost certain frequencies but also add a resonant peak at the cutoff frequency.
- **Reverb and Delay**: These effects can create a sense of space and depth, making the sound more resonant. Use short, reflective reverb settings or delays to enhance the resonance without making the sound too muddy or distant.

### 2. Creating a Sense of Constant "Push"
To give a sound a constant "push" or a feeling of continuous forward momentum, consider the following techniques:

- **Sidechain Compression**: Use sidechain compression, particularly in electronic music, to create a pumping effect. This is often achieved by compressing a sound (like a bass or pad) triggered by the kick drum, making it sound like it's "pushing" and "pulling" with the rhythm of the track.
- **Volume Automation**: Automate the volume of the sound to swell in and out subtly. This can give the illusion of the sound breathing and pushing forward.
- **Rhythmic Elements**: Add rhythmic elements or modulations that sync with the tempo of your track. For instance, use a gated synth or a tremolo effect synchronized with the song's BPM to give a pulsating feel.
- **Dynamics Processing**: Use compressors and limiters to control the dynamics of the sound. A well-compressed sound can maintain a constant energy level, contributing to the sense of push.
- **Harmonic Saturation**: Add harmonic saturation or mild distortion to make the sound fuller and more present in the mix. This can give the illusion that the sound is constantly pushing through the other elements.

Combining these techniques can help you achieve a sound that has both resonance and a sense of constant push. It's also important to consider the context of the mix and how the sound interacts with other elements. Sometimes, the sense of push comes not just from the sound itself but from its relationship with the other components in the track. Experimentation and critical listening are key to finding the right balance and achieving the desired effect.
