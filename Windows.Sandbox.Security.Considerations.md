**Q:** Is it safe to enable Windows Sandbox ? It seems there is a Windows hypervisor vulnerability which allows sleeping persistent malware to reinstall.

**A:** Enabling Windows Sandbox can generally be considered safe for most users, as it provides a secure, isolated environment to run untrusted applications. However, concerns about hypervisor vulnerabilities are valid and should be considered when deciding to use any virtualization technology.

### Key Points on Windows Sandbox and Hypervisor Vulnerabilities

- **Windows Sandbox Functionality**:
  - Windows Sandbox is an isolated, temporary, and disposable environment.
  - Once closed, all software and files in the sandbox are permanently deleted.
  - It relies on Windows Hyper-V to create the virtual environment.

- **Hypervisor Vulnerabilities**:
  - Hypervisors can have vulnerabilities that may be exploited by malicious actors.
  - A notable example is CVE-2021-28476, a critical Hyper-V vulnerability.
  - Such vulnerabilities might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the host system.

- **Microsoft's Response to Vulnerabilities**:
  - Microsoft regularly patches known vulnerabilities.
  - Keeping your system updated reduces the risk associated with known vulnerabilities.
  - Ensure that Windows Update is enabled and set to install updates automatically.

- **Best Practices for Using Windows Sandbox**:
  - **Regular Updates**: Always keep your Windows OS and all software up to date.
  - **Trusted Sources**: Only download and run applications from trusted sources.
  - **Antivirus Software**: Use reliable antivirus and anti-malware software.
  - **Network Isolation**: Consider network isolation settings to limit the sandbox's access to the host network.

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Enable Windows Update**:
   - Make sure your system receives regular security patches.
   - Check for updates frequently, especially if using virtualization technologies.

2. **Use Trusted Applications**:
   - Minimize the risk by running applications from known and trusted developers.

3. **Monitor Security Advisories**:
   - Stay informed about new vulnerabilities and patches released by Microsoft.
   - Implement recommended security measures promptly.

### Conclusion

While there is always some risk associated with using virtualization technologies, enabling Windows Sandbox is generally safe if you follow best practices and keep your system updated. The benefits of having a secure, disposable environment to run untrusted applications often outweigh the risks, particularly if you remain vigilant about updates and security advisories.
