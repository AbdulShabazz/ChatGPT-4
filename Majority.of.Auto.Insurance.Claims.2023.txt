While both collision and comprehensive coverage are important parts of an auto insurance policy, **the majority of claims filed fall under comprehensive coverage**. 

Here's some data to illustrate:

* **79% of insured drivers purchase comprehensive coverage**, compared to 75% who buy collision coverage. (Source: Insurance Information Institute)
* **Claims from comprehensive coverage tend to be more frequent than collision claims**. These can include events like theft, vandalism, weather damage, animal collisions, fire, and falling objects. 
* **Comprehensive claims are typically less expensive than collision claims on average**. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners reports an average comprehensive claim of $1,284, while the average collision claim is $4,822.

So, while collision coverage is crucial for accidents involving other vehicles, the wider range of risks covered by comprehensive makes it the more commonly filed type of claim. However, remember that these are national averages, and the specific claim frequency and cost can vary depending on factors like geographic location, driving habits, and vehicle value.

Here are some additional factors to consider:

* **Location:** If you live in a high-crime area or one prone to severe weather events, your comprehensive claims might be more frequent.
* **Vehicle age and value:** Older cars and those with higher values are more likely to be written off as total losses in an accident, leading to a higher chance of a comprehensive claim.
* **Driving habits:** If you drive frequently or in areas with heavy traffic, your collision claim risk might be higher.

Ultimately, the best type of coverage for you will depend on your individual needs and circumstances. Discussing your options with an insurance agent can help you make an informed decision.
