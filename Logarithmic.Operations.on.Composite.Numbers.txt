If I sum logarithmic values, A + B + ... + Y, into a result, Z, how can I determine if A, B, etc. is contained in Z?

ChatGPT:

If you're summing logarithmic values, you're effectively multiplying the original numbers. The logarithm property that allows this is:

log⁡b(x)+log⁡b(y)=log⁡b(x×y)logb​(x)+logb​(y)=logb​(x×y)

So, if you have:

A=log⁡b(x),B=log⁡b(y),...,Y=log⁡b(w)A=logb​(x),B=logb​(y),...,Y=logb​(w)
and you sum them to get:
Z=A+B+...+YZ=A+B+...+Y
This means:
Z=log⁡b(x×y×...×w)Z=logb​(x×y×...×w)

If you want to check if a specific logarithmic value, say A, is contained in Z, you're basically asking if xx (the number corresponding to A) is a factor of x×y×...×wx×y×...×w.

You can revert from the logarithm to the original number using the inverse of the logarithm (the exponential). If bA=xbA=x, and you find that xx divides x×y×...×wx×y×...×w without leaving a remainder (which it will), then you know that A is contained in Z.

In summary, when you're summing logarithms, each original number corresponding to the logarithmic values becomes a factor of the product. Thus, any individual logarithmic value you added (like A) will always be "contained" in the sum (like Z).
