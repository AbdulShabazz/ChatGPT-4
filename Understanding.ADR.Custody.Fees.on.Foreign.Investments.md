**Q:** What is an ADR custody fee ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** An ADR custody fee, also known as an ADR depositary fee, is a charge associated with American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). These fees are typically imposed by the depositary bank that issues and manages the ADRs.

Here's a brief explanation:

1. Purpose: The fee covers the costs of maintaining the ADR program, including administrative expenses, compliance, and reporting requirements.

2. Who pays: The fee is usually charged to ADR holders (investors who own ADRs).

3. Frequency: It's often collected annually, but the timing can vary.

4. Amount: The fee amount varies but is typically a few cents per ADR share.

5. Collection method: The fee is often deducted directly from dividend payments or charged to the investor's brokerage account.

ADR custody fees are one of the additional costs investors should be aware of when investing in foreign companies through ADRs. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of ADR custody fees?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Is the fee amount arbitrary ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** The ADR custody fee amount is not entirely arbitrary, but it can vary based on several factors. Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. Cost-based: The fee is primarily meant to cover the actual costs incurred by the depositary bank in maintaining the ADR program. These costs include administrative expenses, regulatory compliance, and various services provided to ADR holders.

2. Negotiated: The fee amount is often negotiated between the foreign company issuing the underlying shares and the depositary bank managing the ADR program.

3. Regulated: In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees ADR programs and can review fee structures to ensure they are reasonable.

4. Market competition: Depositary banks compete for ADR business, which can help keep fees in check.

5. Program complexity: More complex ADR programs with additional services may have higher fees.

6. Standardization efforts: There have been industry efforts to standardize these fees, with many programs adopting a fee of $0.01 to $0.03 per ADR share annually.

While there is some flexibility in setting the fee, it's not arbitrary in the sense of being random or without basis. The fee should reflect the actual costs and services provided, though there can be some variation between different ADR programs.

If you'd like more information on how these fees are determined or regulated, I'd be happy to elaborate further.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** It's total BS! All transactions are conducted online !!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** I understand your frustration. You make a valid point that many financial transactions, including those related to ADRs, are now conducted electronically, which has significantly reduced processing costs in many areas of finance.

You're right to question these fees, especially given the digital nature of modern financial transactions. Here are some points to consider:

1. Digital doesn't mean free: Even online systems require maintenance, security, and oversight, which do incur costs.

2. Regulatory compliance: There are still regulatory requirements that depositaries must meet, which can be costly even in a digital environment.

3. Profit motive: It's fair to say that some financial institutions may be using these fees as a revenue stream beyond just covering costs.

4. Lack of transparency: The actual costs versus charges aren't always clear to investors, which can lead to skepticism about the justification for these fees.

5. Industry practice: These fees have been a longstanding practice in the industry, and changing them might face resistance.

Your criticism highlights an important issue in the financial industry - the need for greater transparency and potentially a reevaluation of fee structures in light of technological advancements. 

If you feel strongly about this, you might consider:
- Raising this issue with your broker or financial advisor
- Looking for ADR programs with lower fees
- Advocating for more transparency or regulation in this area

It's healthy to question these practices and push for change if you believe the current system isn't fair or justified.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
