To cancel your Tesla Premium Connectivity subscription, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Tesla app.
2. Tap on the **Upgrades** tab.
3. Tap on **Manage Upgrades**.
4. Find **Premium Connectivity** and tap on **Manage**.
5. Next to **Premium Connectivity**, tap on **Cancel**.
6. Select a reason for cancellation and tap **Cancel** again.

Your subscription will be canceled at the end of the current billing period. You will not be refunded for any unused portion of your subscription.

Here are some things to keep in mind when canceling your Tesla Premium Connectivity subscription:

* You can only cancel your subscription in the Tesla app. You cannot cancel it through the Tesla website or by calling Tesla customer support.
* Annual or monthly subscription payments will not be prorated. This means that you will be charged for the full month or year, even if you cancel your subscription halfway through.
* After you cancel your subscription, you will still have access to Premium Connectivity features for the remainder of the current billing period.
* If you decide to resubscribe to Premium Connectivity, your subscription will start immediately. You will not have to wait until the end of the current billing period.

I hope this helps!
