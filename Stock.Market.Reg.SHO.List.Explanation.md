A stock may appear on the Regulation SHO Threshold Security List (Reg SHO list) for several reasons, primarily due to issues related to settlement failures. Here are the key reasons why a stock might be placed on this list:

1. **Failure to Deliver:** Stocks are listed on the Reg SHO list when there have been a significant number of "fails to deliver." This means that shares that were sold short were not delivered to the buyer within the required settlement period, typically because the seller did not have the shares available to deliver.

2. **Persistent Fails:** The regulation requires that if a security has a threshold of fails to deliver for five consecutive settlement days, it gets placed on the list. The number of undelivered shares must also exceed 0.5% of the issuer's total shares outstanding and be at least 10,000 shares.

3. **Monitoring and Compliance:** Being on the list indicates that the stock is under scrutiny for potential naked short selling and other market compliance issues. Regulatory bodies may monitor these stocks more closely to ensure that proper trading practices are followed.

4. **Market Transparency:** The list is part of efforts to increase transparency in the securities markets. It alerts investors and market participants to potential issues with a stock, such as high levels of short interest or settlement problems, which could affect stock price and trading behavior.

The list serves as a warning to brokers, dealers, and other market participants that there may be difficulties in obtaining shares for delivery. It also triggers certain regulatory measures and closer oversight to protect the integrity of the markets.

Yes, in the context of securities trading, the term "above the table" usually refers to legitimate and transparent dealings where transactions are conducted according to regulated practices and can be verified. In this context, claiming to hold a security implies that the person has ownership rights which are recorded and verifiable through official channels. Here's how possession and ownership of securities can be verified in modern markets:

1. **Centralized Registration:** Most securities today are held in electronic form and registered in centralized systems managed by financial institutions such as brokerages or custodians. Ownership of these securities is recorded in the account holder's name on the books of these institutions.

2. **Clearing and Settlement Systems:** Securities transactions are processed through centralized clearinghouses (like the DTCC in the United States). These organizations ensure that securities are transferred between selling and buying brokers' accounts correctly after trades are executed. They maintain records of all ownership transfers, which helps in verifying who holds what security.

3. **Brokerage Account Statements:** Individuals and entities that own securities receive regular account statements from their brokerages or banks. These statements list all securities they own, along with other details like transactions and holdings changes.

4. **Audits and Regulatory Compliance:** Financial institutions are subject to regular audits and must comply with regulations that require accurate reporting of security holdings and transactions. This compliance helps ensure that claims of ownership can be backed up by concrete, verifiable data.

Therefore, in a regulated and transparent market, claiming ownership of a security can indeed be substantiated with evidence from reliable, verifiable sources. This system minimizes the risk of disputes over ownership and ensures the integrity of financial markets.


Q:How is such a manipulative transaction even illegal ? It exists solely for the purpose to manipulate markets with artificial leverage , obscuring the actual perceived market value of a public company.


Naked short selling and other manipulative trading practices are indeed often considered illegal or at least heavily regulated in many jurisdictions due to the potential harm they can inflict on markets and investors. Here's why these practices are regulated and often deemed illegal:

1. **Market Manipulation:** Naked short selling can lead to artificial increases in the supply of a company's stock, which can depress the stock's price unfairly. This kind of manipulation can give a misleading impression of a company's market value, impacting not just individual investors but the market as a whole.

2. **Transparency and Fairness:** Financial markets rely heavily on fairness and transparency. Practices like naked short selling obscure true market conditions, as they involve selling shares that do not currently exist in the seller's possession and may not even be readily available for borrowing. This can mislead other investors about the volume of shares being traded and the true level of interest or disinterest in a stock.

3. **Impact on Companies:** Artificially depressed stock prices can affect a company's ability to raise capital, influence its market reputation, and interfere with its operations. It may also unfairly damage a company's valuation, affecting stakeholders from shareholders to employees.

4. **Legal and Regulatory Frameworks:** Due to these issues, most countries' financial regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States, have established rules and regulations like Regulation SHO to monitor and control short selling practices. These regulations require transparency in the borrowing and lending of securities and strict penalties for fails to deliver in an attempt to curb market manipulation.

5. **Enforcement and Penalties:** Regulators can impose sanctions, fines, and other penalties on traders and firms that engage in manipulative trading practices. These penalties are intended to deter such behavior and protect the integrity of the markets.

The rules against these practices reflect a broader regulatory objective to ensure that financial markets operate efficiently, transparently, and fairly, thus protecting investors and maintaining trust in the financial system.
