Q:Is there a purely mathematical equation that swaps a pair of integers without software, 
if the first integer in the pair is larger?

ChatGPT-4: Yes, there's a mathematical way to swap two integers a and b without using a temporary variable, 
and without using any particular software. The method works regardless of the initial ordering of the two integers. If a > b, 
these operations will swap the values so that a contains the smaller value and b contains the larger value:

    a = a + b (now, a has the total of the original a and b)
    b = a - b (subtracting the original value of b from the new a gives the original value of a, 
	so now b has the original value of a)
    a = a - b (subtracting the new value of b from the new value of a gives the original value of b, 
	so now a has the original value of b)

After these steps, the original value of a is in b, and the original value of b is in a, 
effectively swapping the two values. If a was originally larger than b, then after the swap, a will be smaller and b will be larger.

Do note, however, that while this method is mathematically sound, it can cause problems in some practical applications, 
such as in programming, due to issues like overflow when a and b are very large, 
or loss of precision when a and b are floating-point numbers. Also, 
this method isn't necessarily faster or more efficient than using a temporary variable to perform the swap, 
especially with modern optimizing compilers.
