How do I encode the size of a C++ binary inside the executable and would this suffice as a robust checksum in production code?

ChatGPT:

Embedding the size of a binary executable within the executable itself is quite challenging. The main issue is that the size of the executable isn't known until it is fully linked, while embedding the size implies modifying the binary, which would change its size. It's a classic "chicken and egg" problem. Any mechanism to do this would likely need to be implemented as part of the linker itself, which is not typically feasible for most developers.

Even if you could manage to embed the size of the binary in the executable itself, this wouldn't be a very robust checksum. A checksum is used to verify the integrity of data and should ideally be unique to the specific content of the data. If two different versions of a binary happened to have the same size, they would have the same checksum in your proposed system, which isn't very useful.

A more traditional approach for checksumming binaries would be to use a cryptographic hash function, like SHA-256. This would produce a relatively short, fixed-size hash that is unique to the content of the binary. You could then use this hash to verify the integrity of the binary.

As for embedding this hash inside the binary itself, you'd face the same challenges as with embedding the size. One possible solution would be to generate the binary without the hash, calculate the hash, and then append it to the binary. The program could then read the hash from its own binary file at runtime and compare it with a freshly calculated hash of the rest of the binary. However, this solution still has potential issues, such as the need for the binary to be able to read its own file, which might not be possible in all environments. Furthermore, this approach would not protect against an attacker who could modify the binary and regenerate the hash.

A more secure way to validate the integrity of a binary is to distribute the hash separately and verify the binary against the hash before execution. This could be done as part of a software update process, for example. In a secure system, this would typically be combined with digital signatures to ensure that the binary and hash haven't been tampered with.

Even if I could manage to embed the size of the binary in the executable itself, would it be a very robust checksum if the checksum was also verified in an API call, or via a third party?

ChatGPT:

Even if you incorporate the size of the binary into the executable and then use it as part of an API call or third-party verification system, it would still not be considered a robust checksum for several reasons:

    Collision: The size of a binary is not unique to its content. Two completely different executables could have the same size. Therefore, the size of a file is not a strong indicator of its content.

    Easily Falsifiable: The size of a binary is fairly easy to manipulate without affecting the functioning of the binary. For example, an attacker could add some non-functional bytes to the end of the binary to make it match a known, valid size.

    Limited Information: The size of the file is a very limited piece of information. Checksums typically take into account all or most of the data in a file, while the size of a file is just a single number.

A more reliable method of verifying a binary would be to use a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256, which generates a hash value that is highly sensitive to the file content. This hash can be distributed separately from the binary, or embedded into an API call to a verification service, for instance.

However, if your goal is to protect the integrity of your binaries, you might want to consider digital signatures. A digital signature uses cryptographic techniques to verify that a binary hasn't been modified. The signature is generated using a private key, and can be verified by anyone with the corresponding public key. This not only verifies the integrity of the binary, but also the authenticity, as it can confirm that the binary came from the holder of the private key. It's more secure and reliable than using just a checksum or hash, and it's widely used in secure software distribution.
