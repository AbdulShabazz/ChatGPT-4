Novel technology such as antilock brakes (ABS) and stability control (ESC) is formally introduced to racing circuits through a process of research, development, testing, and approval.

**Research and development**

The first step is for manufacturers to develop new technologies and prove that they are safe and effective in a variety of racing conditions. This can be done through simulation, testing in controlled environments, and limited use in racing events.

**Testing**

Once a new technology has been developed, it must be extensively tested in real-world racing conditions. This can be done through private testing by manufacturers and racing teams, as well as through testing organized by racing sanctioning bodies.

**Approval**

Once a new technology has been proven to be safe and effective, it must be approved by the relevant racing sanctioning body. This process can vary depending on the sanctioning body, but it typically involves a review of the technology, its testing data, and its potential impact on racing safety.

**Implementation**

Once a new technology has been approved by the relevant sanctioning body, it can be implemented in racing circuits. This can be done by making the technology mandatory for all racing vehicles, or by allowing teams to choose whether or not to use it.

**Examples**

Here are some examples of how novel technology has been formally introduced to racing circuits:

* ABS was first introduced to racing in the early 1980s. It was initially met with resistance from some drivers, who argued that it reduced their control over the car. However, ABS quickly became commonplace in racing, and is now mandatory in most racing series.
* ESC was first introduced to racing in the late 1990s. It was initially only used in sports cars, but it has since become more common in other racing series, including Formula 1.
* Hybrid powertrains were first introduced to racing in the early 2010s. They are now used in a number of racing series, including Formula 1 and the World Endurance Championship.

**The future of racing technology**

New technologies are constantly being developed for racing. Some of the most promising technologies in development include:

* **Artificial intelligence (AI)**: AI is already being used in racing to develop better driver training tools and to improve the performance of racing cars. AI is also being explored as a way to automate some aspects of racing, such as pit stops and refueling.
* **Autonomous racing:** Autonomous racing is still in its early stages of development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the sport. Autonomous racing cars could compete against each other in races without human drivers. This would open up new possibilities for racing, such as racing on public roads or racing in extreme environments.

It is likely that novel technologies will continue to be introduced to racing circuits in the future. These technologies could make racing safer, faster, and more exciting.
