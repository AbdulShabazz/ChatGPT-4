Q:Are artificially intelligent machines proof faster than light travel is possible ? Although a human is only capable of innovating at a certain rate, the innovation rate of all combined humans is consistent. Machines, although energy bound, are not bound computationally by the properties of electromagnetic wave propagation.

The question of whether artificially intelligent machines are proof that faster-than-light (FTL) travel is possible involves a mix of theoretical physics, computer science, and a bit of philosophical inquiry.

Firstly, the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI), even advanced ones, are currently limited by the hardware they run on, which adheres to the laws of physics as we understand them. These laws include the speed of light as a fundamental limit for the propagation of information and energy. Therefore, the current understanding of physics holds that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum.

AI can indeed process information and generate innovations at rates that may far exceed individual human capabilities. This is due to their ability to perform vast numbers of calculations swiftly and to analyze large datasets beyond human capacity. However, the speed at which an AI operates is still fundamentally bound by the speed of light in terms of signal transmission and propagation within and between hardware components. This is because the components themselves—be they electronic or photonic—are limited by the same physical laws that restrict human-made machines and communication systems.

Moreover, the computational processes of AI, no matter how fast and efficient, are not akin to physical travel or the transmission of information over distances in the sense meant by faster-than-light phenomena in physics. While AI might accelerate the pace of innovation, including potentially new theories and technologies relevant to space travel, this does not imply that AI itself can overcome or bypass the light-speed barrier established by Einstein's theory of relativity.

In summary, while AI can enhance and speed up human innovation, including potentially in areas relevant to space travel, it does not in itself provide proof or a method for achieving faster-than-light travel according to our current understanding of physics. The notion of faster-than-light travel remains speculative and a topic of theoretical exploration within the realms of physics, distinct from the advancements in AI.
