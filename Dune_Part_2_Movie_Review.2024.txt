Better than part one, but still over-hyped...

I sat through the entire 2 hour movie and I did not sense any areas where the film's pace seems to let down.However, at the same time, the film fails to build itself to epic proportions:

The film's score, cinematography, acting,SFX, and set direction are fine; the issue is the script or screenplay.The writer(s) does a poor job of establishing the outward arcs that the characters each desire, aside from the plot, and the inner struggles they face at any moment, followed by their strategy for overcoming these obstacles, thus revealing their character. Actions reveal character. However we don't know their momentary motivations, and so their actions seemed pre-planned, predestined, and mechanical, with us out of the loop, watching these strategic moves without any context or proper stakes, revealed in each moment, for us to wonder how we would handle the situation.

Paul Atreides -- does he change? How??

Do we care?

No, not really.
