The idea is attributed to the physicist John Archibald Wheeler, who proposed a thought experiment known as the "one-electron universe" in telephone conversations with Richard Feynman. This hypothesis suggests that all electrons and positrons are actually manifestations of a single entity moving backwards and forwards in time. It's more a philosophical or conceptual thought experiment than a physical theory meant to be taken literally.

As of my last update in April 2023, this idea remains in the realm of speculative thought experiments rather than established physics. It hasn't been proven or debunked in the conventional sense because it doesn't offer specific, testable predictions in the way that established theories in physics do. Modern physics, including quantum mechanics and the standard model of particle physics, does not incorporate the one-electron universe as a foundational concept.

Instead, the field has advanced through other theories and experiments that provide a more complex and nuanced understanding of particles, their interactions, and the nature of the universe. Concepts like quantum field theory, the Higgs mechanism, and the exploration of particles in accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider have significantly expanded our understanding beyond what the one-electron universe hypothesis could offer.

While Wheeler's idea remains an interesting and creative way to think about particles and time, it's important to distinguish between such thought experiments and the empirical basis of contemporary physics.
