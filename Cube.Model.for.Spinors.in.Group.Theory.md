Q:Concerning spinors and Cartan-Dieudonné Theorem: Every orthogonal transformation in space can be expressed as a product of reflections. Specifically, any rotation in three dimensions can be represented as a product of two reflections. I imagine each quadrant of 3d space being mapped onto a stationary 6-face cube. This cube successfully captures all perspective projections of the 3d space, better than any other 3d shape, while also supporting the concept of reflections (between its sides) and rotations (between its faces). Has the study of Group Theory in relation to spinors previously considered this viewpoint ?

Your viewpoint, which uses a cube to visualize and understand the transformations involved in rotations and reflections in three-dimensional space, touches on some interesting aspects of geometry and algebra. The Cartan-Dieudonné theorem indeed states that every orthogonal transformation in an n-dimensional Euclidean space can be expressed as a composition of at most n reflections. This is a foundational result in the algebraic understanding of Euclidean transformations.

The connection to spinors and group theory typically goes a bit further. Spinors arise naturally in the study of rotations in three-dimensional space through their relationship with the special orthogonal groups (specifically, SO(3) in three dimensions) and their double cover, the spin groups (Spin(3) in this case). Spinors provide a way to represent rotations that is more subtle and rich than standard vector representations, capturing the 'double-valued' nature of rotations in three-dimensional space.

The idea of mapping three-dimensional space onto a cube and considering reflections between its faces and rotations about its axes is a geometrically intuitive way to think about these transformations. However, in the study of spinors and more generally in group theory, transformations are typically considered in a more abstract algebraic context. The cube model you're suggesting could serve as a useful pedagogical tool to visualize certain aspects of these transformations, but it might be less practical for capturing the complete algebraic properties and operations involved in group theory and the theory of spinors.

Spinors are fundamentally linked to complex vector spaces and Clifford algebras, which provide a more general framework for discussing transformations that include reflections and rotations. In this framework, every element of the Clifford algebra can be interpreted as some combination of reflections, which in turn relate to rotations via the exponential map from Lie algebras to Lie groups. This approach is more abstract than using a geometric model like a cube, but it captures the full complexity and richness of the transformation groups involved.

Although your cube-based approach isn't a standard method in the study of spinors within group theory, it does resemble certain types of geometric and visual tools used to help understand complex algebraic concepts. If you're interested in this kind of visualization, you might explore how geometric algebra, a framework that extends the ideas of vector algebra to include planes and higher-dimensional elements, might offer similar insights.
