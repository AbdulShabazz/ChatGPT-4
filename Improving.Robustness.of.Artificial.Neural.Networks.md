**Q:** Artificial Neural Networks condense the desired behavior of computational models to, for example, guarantee a minimal optimal operational performance, but this reduction is brittle. So, what if the artificial neural network modeled the problem in question at a higher level of abstraction? In essence, adding an additional layer of abstraction into the computational model. The goal being an inherent form of exception handling guaranteed to bound the results of the model to an a priori solution space.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** That's an interesting idea to improve the robustness and reliability of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Let me break this down and share my thoughts:

Current Challenges:

You're correct that traditional ANNs are often brittle - they learn to solve specific tasks based on the training data and objective functions used, but can struggle to generalize well to novel situations or handle exceptions gracefully. This is especially problematic for safety-critical applications where unexpected failures could have severe consequences.

Proposed Solution: 

Your suggestion of adding a higher level of abstraction to the computational model is intriguing. Essentially, rather than directly mapping inputs to outputs, the ANN would first map the problem into a more abstract representation. This abstract representation could capture the essential structure and constraints of the problem domain.

Then, the ANN's outputs would be generated from this abstract representation, rather than directly from the raw inputs. Crucially, the abstract representation could be designed to inherently bound the solution space and handle exceptions.

Potential Benefits:

- **Improved generalization:** By learning a more general, abstract representation of the problem, the ANN may be better able to handle novel inputs and situations beyond just what it saw during training.

- **Exception handling:** Inappropriate or out-of-distribution inputs could be elegantly handled at the abstract representation level, preventing the model from generating unsafe or nonsensical outputs.

- **Interpretability:** The abstract representation level could provide a more human-interpretable view of the ANN's reasoning, rather than treating it fully as a black box. This is valuable for debugging, auditing, and building trust in the system.

Challenges and Considerations:

- **Designing the abstraction:** Significant care and domain expertise would be needed to design an appropriate abstraction layer for each problem. It needs to be rich enough to capture the problem structure, yet constrained enough to provide the desired exception handling and output bounding.

- **Training complexity:** Adding this extra level of abstraction may complicate the training process of the ANN. New techniques may be needed to effectively train the network to generate robust abstract representations.

- **Efficiency:** Depending on the implementation, the extra abstraction layer could add computational overhead. There may be a tradeoff between robustness and efficiency.

Overall, I think this is a promising direction to explore for making ANNs more robust and reliable. It aligns with research trends into  imbuing ANNs with more structure, constraints and domain knowledge. With further research to address the challenges, incorporating higher-level abstractions could be a powerful tool for mission-critical AI systems.

Some relevant research areas to draw from may include:

- Ontology-based neural networks 
- Neuro-symbolic AI which combines ANNs with symbolic knowledge representations
- Abstract interpretation techniques from program analysis
- Bayesian deep learning for quantifying uncertainty

Let me know if you have any other thoughts! It's an exciting area with lots of potential.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
