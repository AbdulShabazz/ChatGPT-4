**HIFIMAN Ananda** and **HIFIMAN Jade II** adjustable head straps **DO NOT** fit the **HIFIMAN HE1000se**. The HE1000se has a different headband design, with a wider and more supportive headband cushion. The Ananda and Jade II headbands are not wide enough to properly support the HE1000se, and they may also put too much pressure on the top of your head.

**Mixed HIFIMAN headphone line headstraps** are **not interchangeable** in general. Each HIFIMAN headphone model has a unique headband design, and the headbands are not interchangeable between models. This is because the headbands are designed to fit the specific shape and size of the earcups.

However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, the headband cushions on the Ananda and Jade II are interchangeable. Additionally, some aftermarket headband cushions are designed to fit multiple HIFIMAN headphone models.

If you are unsure whether or not a particular headband will fit your HIFIMAN headphones, it is always best to contact HIFIMAN customer support for assistance.

Here is a table of HIFIMAN headphone models and their compatible headbands:

| Headphone Model | Compatible Headbands |
|---|---|
| HIFIMAN Ananda | HIFIMAN Ananda headband |
| HIFIMAN Jade II | HIFIMAN Jade II headband |
| HIFIMAN HE1000se | HIFIMAN HE1000se headband |
| HIFIMAN Sundara | HIFIMAN Sundara headband |
| HIFIMAN Arya | HIFIMAN Arya headband |

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
