## Perplexity AI Pro

**Q:** Is Anthropic's pro model designated as Anthropic AI Pro Claude 3.5 Sonnet ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ (Note: I don't feel the following completion is all correct)

**A:** No, Anthropic's pro model is not designated as "Anthropic AI Pro Claude 3.5 Sonnet." Instead, the pro model is referred to as "Claude 3 Opus." The Claude 3.5 Sonnet is a mid-tier model in Anthropic's lineup, positioned between the smaller Haiku model and the high-end Opus model. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is designed to balance performance and speed, making it suitable for a wide range of tasks, but it is not the pro model[1][2][3][5][6].
