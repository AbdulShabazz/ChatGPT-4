Here's a breakdown of how phase variation affects sinusoidal frequency and how to calculate the variance:

**Understanding Phase and Frequency**

* **Phase:**  The phase of a sinusoidal wave describes its starting point relative to a reference. It's usually measured in degrees or radians.
* **Frequency:** The frequency of a sinusoidal wave represents how many complete cycles it makes in one second. It's measured in Hertz (Hz).

**The Relationship**

While it's true that you can influence the *instantaneous frequency* of a signal by varying its phase over time, this doesn't directly change the underlying frequency of the sinusoid. Here's why:

* **Fundamental Frequency:**  A sinusoid has a fundamental frequency that's determined by the rate at which it repeats its pattern. Changing the phase shifts the wave in time, but it doesn't alter this repetition rate. 
* **Instantaneous Frequency:** By changing the phase at different rates over time, you can make the wave *appear* to have a changing frequency for short periods. This is the concept of instantaneous frequency.

**Calculating Frequency Variance**

To  calculate the maximum variance in the instantaneous frequency due to phase changes, consider the following:

1. **Maximum Phase Shift:** If you can shift the phase by up to a full period, you're essentially shifting it by 360 degrees or 2π radians.

2. **Relationship between Phase, Frequency, and Time:** The phase of a sinusoid is related to its frequency and time by the equation:

   ```
   phase(t) = 2πft + φ
   ```

   where:
    * phase(t) is the phase at time t
    * f is the frequency
    * t is time
    * φ is the initial phase offset

3. **Instantaneous Frequency:** Taking the derivative of the phase equation gives us the instantaneous frequency:

    ```
    f_inst(t) = df/dt = 2πf
    ```

**Calculation for a 40 Hz Signal:**

1. **Maximum Phase Shift:** 2π radians 
2. **Original Frequency:** f = 40 Hz

3. **Maximum Instantaneous Frequency Deviation:** Since the instantaneous frequency is directly proportional to the original frequency, the maximum variation would be equal to the original frequency itself. So the frequency could potentially vary between 0 Hz and 80 Hz

**Important Notes:**

* This type of frequency variation produces a signal known as a chirp, where the frequency changes over time.
* Actual frequency variance depends on how you are controlling the phase variation. If the phase variation is not linear, the frequency variation will be different.
