It is difficult to give an exact number of publicly traded companies that have changed or augmented their business models in the past five years, as there is no definitive definition of what constitutes a "pivot." However, a recent study by McKinsey found that **70% of companies have made significant changes to their business models in the past three years**, suggesting that pivoting is becoming increasingly common.

Here are a few examples of publicly traded companies that have pivoted in the past five years:

* **Netflix:** Netflix started out as a DVD-by-mail service, but it pivoted to streaming video in 2007. This pivot has been incredibly successful, and Netflix is now one of the most popular streaming services in the world.
* **Amazon:** Amazon started out as an online bookstore, but it has since expanded into a wide range of businesses, including e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. Amazon is constantly pivoting to new businesses, and it is now one of the most valuable companies in the world.
* **Microsoft:** Microsoft started out as a software company, but it has since pivoted to cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Microsoft's pivot to cloud computing has been particularly successful, and the company is now one of the leading cloud computing providers.
* **Tesla:** Tesla started out as an electric car company, but it has since expanded into solar energy and battery storage. Tesla is also developing self-driving cars. Tesla is one of the most innovative companies in the world, and it is constantly pivoting to new businesses.
* **Walmart:** Walmart started out as a brick-and-mortar retailer, but it has since expanded into e-commerce. Walmart is also developing new technologies, such as cashierless stores and drone delivery. Walmart is one of the largest retailers in the world, and it is pivoting to stay ahead of the competition.

These are just a few examples of publicly traded companies that have pivoted in the past five years. Pivoting is becoming increasingly common as companies need to adapt to changing market conditions and consumer preferences.
