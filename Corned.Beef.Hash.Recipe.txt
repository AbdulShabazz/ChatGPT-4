Corned Beef Hash with White Rice

Ingredients:

    1 cup white rice
    2 cups water
    1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil
    1 medium onion, diced
    2 cloves garlic, minced
    1 can (12 oz) corned beef hash
    1 red bell pepper, diced
    2 green onions, sliced (optional, for garnish)
    Salt and pepper, to taste

Instructions:

    Cook the Rice:
        Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
        In a saucepan, bring the 2 cups of water to a boil.
        Add the rice, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the rice is tender and water is absorbed. Remove from heat and set aside.

    Prepare the Corned Beef Hash:
        In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the diced onions and sauté until they become translucent, about 2-3 minutes.
        Stir in the minced garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds.
        Add the corned beef hash to the skillet and break it apart with a spatula. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally until it's lightly browned.
        Mix in the diced red bell pepper and continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes until the pepper softens.

    Combine and Serve:
        Season the corned beef hash mixture with salt and pepper to taste.
        Serve the corned beef hash over a bed of white rice.
        Garnish with sliced green onions if desired.

You can also add other vegetables of your choice to the hash or include a side of steamed or sautéed greens to round out the meal. Enjoy!
