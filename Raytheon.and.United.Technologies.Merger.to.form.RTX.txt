Raytheon changed its name to RTX for several reasons, including:

**1. Creating a new, unified brand identity:** In 2020, Raytheon merged with United Technologies Corporation to form Raytheon Technologies. The new name, RTX, was chosen to create a unified brand identity that better represents the combined company and its diverse businesses. It signals a shift from the previous structure of two separate entities to a single, integrated organization.

**2. Signaling a focus on innovation and the future:** RTX aims to project an image of a modern, forward-thinking company that is at the forefront of innovation in the aerospace and defense industries. The name is shorter and more contemporary than "Raytheon Technologies," and it avoids the potential for confusion with the legacy Raytheon businesses, which now operate as sub-brands within RTX.

**3. Aligning with customer priorities:** The company believes that the new name will better resonate with its customers in the aerospace and defense sectors. The name is more concise and easier to remember, and it conveys a sense of strength and reliability.

**4. Simplifying communication:** RTX is intended to be easier to say and write than "Raytheon Technologies," which can be cumbersome in everyday communication. This can be beneficial for internal communication, media relations, and marketing initiatives.

**5. Building brand recognition:** While the name change is relatively new, RTX is actively working to build brand recognition. This includes a major rebranding campaign, as well as ongoing efforts to promote the new name through marketing and communications channels.

Overall, the name change to RTX reflects a strategic move by Raytheon Technologies to create a more unified and forward-looking brand identity. It is intended to better represent the company's diverse businesses and position it for continued success in the future.
