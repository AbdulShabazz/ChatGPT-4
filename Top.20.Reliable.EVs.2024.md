**Q:** What are the top 20 EVs to date, ranked by reliability, in table form ?

**A:** Creating a ranked table of the top 20 electric vehicles (EVs) based on reliability involves synthesizing data from various sources such as consumer reports, automotive review sites, and reliability surveys. Reliability is often measured based on the frequency of problems reported by owners, the severity of those issues, and the cost and ease of repair. Below is a table of the top 20 EVs to date, ranked by reliability.

### Key Factors Considered:
- **Owner Satisfaction**: Based on feedback from thousands of EV owners.
- **Frequency of Problems**: How often users report issues with their vehicles.
- **Severity of Problems**: The seriousness of the issues (e.g., critical component failures vs. minor inconveniences).
- **Cost and Ease of Repair**: How expensive and difficult it is to fix common problems.
- **Warranty and Service Support**: Manufacturer support in addressing reliability issues.

### Notes:
- **Tesla Models** tend to be popular and reliable, with the Model 3 consistently ranking high due to its broad adoption and fewer reported issues.
- **Legacy Brands** like Nissan and Chevrolet have reliable models like the Leaf and Bolt, owing to years of refinement and mass-market appeal.
- **Newer Entrants**: Brands like Polestar, Rivian, and Mercedes-Benz have entered the market with strong offerings, but still need to build long-term reliability data.
- **European Brands** like Audi, Porsche, and Jaguar have shown good initial reliability but often at higher service costs.

This ranking is based on currently available data and might change as new models and more data become available.

**Q:** I noticed LUCID is not on this list!

**A:** Lucid is indeed a prominent player in the electric vehicle market, particularly with their luxury sedan, the Lucid Air. However, the Lucid Air is relatively new to the market, with its first deliveries beginning in late 2021. Given its recent entry, there isn't as much long-term reliability data available compared to other vehicles on the list. 

Here are some key reasons why Lucid might not appear on a list of top 20 EVs ranked by reliability:

1. **Limited Long-Term Data**: Since the Lucid Air is new, there isn't enough historical data to accurately assess its long-term reliability. Many of the vehicles on the list have been on the market for several years, allowing for more comprehensive reliability assessments.

2. **Initial Production Hurdles**: Like many new automakers, Lucid has faced some production challenges and early quality control issues. These are common with new vehicle launches, especially with companies ramping up production for the first time.

3. **High Expectations vs. Reality**: The Lucid Air is positioned as a high-end luxury EV, and with that comes high consumer expectations. Any minor issue might be more noticeable and impactful on reliability ratings compared to mass-market vehicles.

4. **Limited Customer Base**: With fewer units on the road compared to established brands, there's a smaller sample size for reliability data. This makes it harder to draw definitive conclusions.

That said, the Lucid Air has received praise for its design, performance, and technology, and it may very well rank highly in future reliability studies as more data becomes available. If reliability improves and solid data emerges, Lucid could certainly find its place among the top-ranked EVs.
