**Q:** Conductivity increases when replacing an element in the periodic table with a better suited one. But what is the theoretical upper limit of the conductivity scale ? Are there other states of matter which achieve this theoretical limit ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** To address your interesting question, let's break it down into parts:

1. Theoretical upper limit of conductivity:

The theoretical upper limit of electrical conductivity is infinite conductivity, where there is zero resistance to the flow of electric current. This state is known as superconductivity.

2. States of matter achieving this limit:

Superconductivity is indeed observed in certain materials under specific conditions:

a) Conventional superconductors:
Many metals and alloys become superconductors when cooled to very low temperatures, typically near absolute zero. Examples include mercury, lead, and niobium-titanium alloys.

b) High-temperature superconductors:
Some materials, particularly certain ceramic compounds, can achieve superconductivity at relatively higher temperatures (though still quite cold by everyday standards). For example, some copper-oxide based materials become superconductors at temperatures above 77 K (-196°C), which is the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.

c) Room-temperature superconductors:
This is an active area of research. Some materials have been reported to exhibit superconductivity at or near room temperature, but under extreme pressures. For instance, in 2020, a hydrogen-rich compound was reported to show superconductivity at about 15°C, but under pressures of about 267 gigapascals.

It's worth noting that while these materials achieve effectively infinite conductivity, they do so only under specific conditions. The search for materials that can maintain superconductivity under more practical conditions is an ongoing area of research in physics and materials science.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of superconductivity or the physics behind it?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Ah, there are material structures which can be synthesized to replicate these pressures. But what is the relationship between pressure, temperature, EM fields, and current flow ??​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** You're right to point out that the relationship between pressure, temperature, electromagnetic fields, and current flow is complex and fascinating. Let's explore these connections:

1. Pressure and Temperature:

- Generally, increasing pressure tends to favor superconductivity, often allowing it to occur at higher temperatures.
- This is because pressure can alter the material's crystal structure and electron behavior, potentially enhancing electron pairing (a key mechanism in superconductivity).
- The relationship isn't always linear though - in some materials, pressure can suppress superconductivity.

2. Temperature:

- Lower temperatures generally promote superconductivity by reducing thermal vibrations that can disrupt electron pairing.
- The critical temperature (Tc) is the point below which a material becomes superconducting.

3. Electromagnetic Fields:

- Strong magnetic fields typically suppress superconductivity.
- There's a critical magnetic field strength (Hc) above which superconductivity breaks down.
- Some superconductors (Type II) can maintain partial superconductivity in higher fields through the formation of magnetic vortices.

4. Current Flow:

- Superconductors can carry current with zero resistance up to a critical current density (Jc).
- Exceeding Jc causes the material to revert to a normal, resistive state.

5. Interplay of These Factors:

- These parameters are interdependent. For instance, the critical magnetic field and critical current density both typically decrease as temperature increases towards Tc.
- This relationship is often represented in phase diagrams showing the superconducting state as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and current density.

6. Material-Specific Behaviors:

- Different materials respond uniquely to these factors. For example, some iron-based superconductors show increased Tc under pressure, while copper-oxide superconductors may show more complex behavior.

7. Quantum Effects:

- At the microscopic level, these macroscopic parameters influence the quantum behavior of electrons, particularly their ability to form Cooper pairs, which is essential for superconductivity.

Understanding these relationships is crucial for developing new superconducting materials and technologies. The field continues to evolve, with researchers exploring novel materials and conditions to achieve superconductivity in more practical regimes.

Would you like to delve deeper into any specific aspect of these relationships or discuss potential applications?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Q:** Wait! So, let me get this right: if superconductivity is achieved in say a closed vacuum, its properties can still be exploited remotely via quantum entanglement ??​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Your question touches on an interesting intersection of superconductivity and quantum mechanics, but there are some important clarifications to make:

1. Superconductivity and vacuum:
Superconductivity is a property of materials, not of vacuum. It requires a physical substance with specific electronic properties. A vacuum, by definition, lacks matter and thus cannot be a superconductor.

2. Remote exploitation via quantum entanglement:
Quantum entanglement and superconductivity are distinct phenomena:

- Quantum entanglement involves correlated quantum states between particles, potentially over large distances.
- Superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomenon involving the collective behavior of electrons in a material.

While both are quantum effects, they don't directly allow for "remote exploitation" of superconductivity in the way you're suggesting.

3. Relationship between superconductivity and quantum information:
That said, there are connections between superconductivity and quantum information:

- Superconducting circuits are used in some quantum computing architectures.
- Certain superconducting devices can generate entangled photon pairs.

4. Limitations:
Even in these applications, the superconducting properties themselves are not being "exploited remotely." The superconductor needs to be physically present and maintained in its superconducting state.

5. Theoretical considerations:
While quantum mechanics allows for some "spooky action at a distance" (as Einstein famously described entanglement), it doesn't allow for faster-than-light communication or remote control of physical properties like superconductivity.

To summarize, while superconductivity and quantum entanglement are both quantum phenomena with potential applications in quantum technologies, they don't combine in a way that would allow remote exploitation of superconducting properties through entanglement alone.
