If NVIDIA manufacturers the RTX series GPUs, how are Gigabyte and others that put their name on the GPU cards associated with them?

ChatGPT:

NVIDIA designs and manufactures the GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) themselves, like the chips in the RTX series. However, NVIDIA doesn't typically produce the final consumer graphics cards you might buy at a retailer. Instead, they produce what's called a "reference design" or "Founders Edition" cards.

Companies like Gigabyte, ASUS, MSI, EVGA, and others are what we call "board partners." These partners take NVIDIA's GPU designs and:

    Custom PCB Designs: They might modify the printed circuit board (PCB) design to add or change features, perhaps making it more robust, or changing the layout to fit their cooling solutions.

    Cooling Solutions: Most board partners develop their own cooling solutions, often improving on the reference design with larger or more fans, better heat dissipation, or even water cooling.

    Factory Overclocking: Some board partners release versions of their cards that are overclocked beyond NVIDIA's default specifications, offering potentially better performance.

    Aesthetics and Lighting: Board partners also often add their own aesthetic touches, including RGB lighting, backplates, and other design elements.

    Additional Software: Some board partners include their own software utilities that help

    Marketing and Distribution: These companies have their own distribution channels, marketing strategies, and customer service departments.

So, while NVIDIA is responsible for the core technology and foundational design, board partners like Gigabyte adapt, enhance, and distribute these GPUs to end

So nvidia owns and develops the IP technology as well as the "Founders Edition" cards?

ChatGPT:

Yes, exactly!

    IP Technology: NVIDIA owns and develops the intellectual property (IP) for the GPU technology. This includes the architecture (like Turing, Ampere, etc.), the CUDA cores, ray-tracing cores, tensor cores, and other technical innovations that make up the GPU.

    Founders Edition Cards: NVIDIA designs what they call "Founders Edition" cards, which are their vision of how the GPU should be presented. These cards usually come with a reference PCB design and a cooling solution that NVIDIA believes is optimal for their GPUs. In some cases, the Founders Edition cards might even feature unique designs or premium materials that are not common in the typical aftermarket solutions. They serve as a standard or baseline, but also as premium offerings in their own right.

After NVIDIA releases the Founders Edition and the core GPU technology, their board partners (like Gigabyte, ASUS, MSI, etc.) then take that technology and design their own variations of the graphics cards, often with different cooling solutions, aesthetics, and other features, as previously mentioned.
