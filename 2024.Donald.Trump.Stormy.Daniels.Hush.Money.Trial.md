**Q:** Is the New York prosecutor in the Stormy Daniels hush money case asking for jail time ?

**A:** According to recent reports, the New York prosecutor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, is indeed seeking jail time for former President Donald Trump in the Stormy Daniels hush money case. The prosecutor has argued that Trump's role in the payment of $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016, allegedly made to silence her about an affair she claimed to have had with Trump, constitutes a felony.
The specific charges against Trump include falsifying business records and committing a felony related to the payment. If convicted, Trump could face up to four years in prison. However, it's important to note that Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has characterized the case as politically motivated.
Please keep in mind that this is a developing story, and the situation may change as more information becomes available.
