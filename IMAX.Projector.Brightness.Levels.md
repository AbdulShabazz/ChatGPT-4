**Q:** What is the typical brightness output in nits and or lumens of an IMAX screen projector ?

**A:** IMAX screens are known for their exceptional brightness, which enhances the viewing experience, especially in 3D. However, the exact brightness can vary depending on the specific IMAX theater and projector setup. Here's what we know:

1. IMAX with Laser: This is IMAX's latest projection system, which uses a laser light source. It is capable of delivering up to 1.43 billion colors and a brightness of up to 58 foot-lamberts (fL), which translates to about 198 candela per square meter (cd/mÂ²) or nits.

2. IMAX Xenon: Prior to the introduction of laser technology, IMAX used xenon arc lamps. These setups could deliver brightness levels up to 22 fL (about 75 nits).

3. Lumen output: IMAX projectors are capable of producing a light output of around 30,000 lumens, significantly higher than a standard cinema projector, which typically outputs 2,000 to 6,000 lumens.

It's important to note that IMAX screens are much larger than standard cinema screens, so the brightness is spread over a larger area. The combination of high brightness, large screen size, and high resolution is what creates the immersive IMAX experience.
