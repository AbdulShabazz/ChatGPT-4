Does the iPhone 14 bluetooth use more energy than the built in speakers?

ChatGPT:

As of my last update in September 2021, the iPhone 14 had not been released, so I cannot provide specific details about its Bluetooth energy consumption versus its built-in speakers. However, I can provide a general understanding based on previous iPhones and similar devices.

    Bluetooth Energy Consumption: Modern Bluetooth, especially Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), is designed to be power-efficient. When you're streaming audio to a Bluetooth device, like headphones or a speaker, your iPhone is using energy to maintain the connection and transmit data.

    Built-in Speaker Energy Consumption: Playing audio through the iPhone's built-in speakers also requires energy. The louder the volume, the more power is generally consumed.

Comparatively:

    Listening at a low volume through the built-in speakers might consume less power than maintaining a Bluetooth connection to a device and streaming audio.

    Listening at maximum volume through the built-in speakers could consume more power than a Bluetooth connection, especially if it's a connection using Bluetooth Low Energy.

Remember that several factors can influence energy consumption, including the specific Bluetooth protocol in use, the efficiency of the external Bluetooth device, the volume level for built-in speakers, and any other background processes running on the iPhone.

To get the most accurate answer for the iPhone 14, you would need to refer to Apple's documentation or testing from independent reviewers after its release.
