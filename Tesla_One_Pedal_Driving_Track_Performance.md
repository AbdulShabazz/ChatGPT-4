Tesla's one-pedal driving feature, which utilizes regenerative braking to slow the car when the accelerator is released, indeed has some performance implications, particularly on the track. However, the question of whether it directly leads to improved track times compared to traditional non-regenerative braking systems can be complex and depends on several factors.

1. **Regenerative Braking Efficiency**: Regenerative braking captures kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost as heat in traditional brakes and converts it into electrical energy, which recharges the battery. This feature is beneficial for overall efficiency and extends the range of the vehicle, but its impact on track performance is more nuanced.

2. **Battery and Weight Distribution**: Electric vehicles (EVs), including Tesla models, typically have better weight distribution due to the placement of the battery pack. This can improve handling and stability on a track, potentially contributing to better lap times. However, this is a broader characteristic of EVs and not solely attributable to one-pedal driving.

3. **Driving Dynamics and Control**: One-pedal driving allows for very precise control of vehicle speed using just the accelerator pedal, which can be advantageous in a track setting. Drivers can fine-tune their entry and exit speeds in corners more smoothly without the abrupt transition between different pedals. This might lead to improved cornering speeds and potentially better overall track times.

4. **Driver Skill and Preferences**: The effectiveness of one-pedal driving on a track also heavily depends on the driver's skill level and their familiarity with the system. Drivers accustomed to traditional braking might initially find one-pedal driving challenging on a track, while those experienced with it might leverage its benefits more effectively.

5. **Vehicle Setup and Track Type**: The specific configuration of the Tesla vehicle and the type of track also play crucial roles. Some tracks with lots of tight corners and braking zones might benefit more from one-pedal driving due to its smoother deceleration characteristics, while high-speed tracks with fewer braking zones might not see as much benefit.

In summary, while one-pedal driving in Tesla vehicles can provide some advantages in terms of efficiency and vehicle control, whether it leads to improved track times compared to non-regenerative systems can vary. It largely depends on the track layout, vehicle setup, and the driver's ability to exploit the unique driving dynamics of regenerative braking. More controlled, comparative track studies would be necessary to quantify these effects precisely.
