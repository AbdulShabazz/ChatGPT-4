Most U.S. political candidates running for federal office are effective at saying what voters need to hear to vote for them. So what is the single best indicator to gauge a politician's true legislative agenda and that it matches what they say and whether they will be successful in office.

ChatGPT:

Determining a political candidate's true legislative agenda and their likelihood of success can be challenging due to the myriad of factors at play. While no single indicator is foolproof, a candidate's voting record (if they've previously held office) is often one of the most revealing indicators. It offers:

    Consistency: If a candidate has consistently voted in line with their campaign promises or stated beliefs, it provides evidence of their commitment to those issues.
    Priorities: A voting record can show which issues a politician prioritizes when faced with competing interests.
    Effectiveness: The number and significance of bills they've sponsored or co-sponsored, and how many of those became law, can indicate their legislative efficacy.

However, for candidates without a prior legislative record, consider:

    Endorsements: Who supports the candidate can give insights into their likely policy priorities.
    Campaign Financing: Who funds their campaign might indicate potential influences or allegiances.
    Past Actions & Statements: Even if they haven't held office, their professional and public history can shed light on their positions.

Regardless, always consider a mix of indicators and be wary of relying too heavily on any single source.
