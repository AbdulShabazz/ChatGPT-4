Here are some signs that your rear automotive brake drums might be worn:

**Sounds:**

* **Scraping or grinding:** This is the most common sign of worn brake shoes. When the lining on the brake shoes wears down, the metal backing plate will start to come in contact with the drum, making a harsh scraping or grinding sound when you apply the brakes.
* **High-pitched squealing:** This can also be caused by worn brake shoes, especially if they are contaminated with oil or grease.
* **Clunking or thudding:** This might indicate that the brake drums are out of round or have cracks, which can be dangerous.

**Performance:**

* **Soft or spongy brake pedal:** This could mean that there is air in the brake lines, which can be caused by worn brake drums. However, it could also be due to other issues with the braking system.
* **Reduced braking performance:** If your brakes take longer than usual to stop your car, or if you feel like you have to press the pedal harder than usual, it could be a sign of worn brake drums.
* **Pulling to one side:** If your car pulls to one side when you apply the brakes, it could be caused by unevenly worn brake shoes or drums.

**Other:**

* **Excessive brake dust:** If you see a lot of brake dust around your rear wheels, it could be a sign that the brake shoes are wearing down prematurely.
* **Loose parking brake:** If your parking brake doesn't seem to hold the car as well as it used to, it could be because the brake drums are worn.

**Important:** If you notice any of these signs, it's important to have your brakes checked by a qualified mechanic as soon as possible. Worn brake drums can be dangerous and can lead to accidents.

Here are some additional tips:

* Have your brakes checked regularly, even if you don't notice any problems.
* Pay attention to how your car feels when you brake. Any change in performance should be investigated.
* Don't wait until your brakes are completely worn out to have them replaced. Replacing worn brakes sooner rather than later will save you money in the long run.

I hope this information helps!
