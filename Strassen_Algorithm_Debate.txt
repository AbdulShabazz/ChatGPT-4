You're correct in noting a crucial distinction between algorithmic equivalence and algebraic equivalence, particularly in the context of Strassen's algorithm for matrix multiplication. Let's clarify these concepts:

- **Algorithmic Equivalence** refers to two algorithms performing the same task (in this case, matrix multiplication) with potentially different methods or steps but ultimately producing the same result. The efficiency or the number of operations might vary, but the output is identical given the same input.

- **Algebraic Equivalence** means that two expressions are identical in value for all values of their variables, following directly from algebraic laws and identities. In the context of matrix multiplication, this would mean performing the exact same series of algebraic operations.

Strassen's algorithm, by introducing a clever rearrangement of operations and exploiting mathematical properties, reduces the number of multiplication operations required to perform matrix multiplication. This reduction is achieved not by finding an algebraically equivalent form of the naive multiplication method (where each element of the resulting matrix is computed directly from the corresponding row and column multiplications) but by transforming the problem into one where fewer multiplications can produce the necessary intermediate values for the final result.

The key insight of Strassen and similar algorithms is that they find a more efficient pathway (algorithmically) to arrive at the same result as the naive approach. They do this not by performing the same operations in a slightly optimized manner but by fundamentally changing the operations performed. This means:

- They are not algebraically equivalent in the sense that they perform the same operations in a different order or simply optimize the existing algebraic operations. Instead, they reorganize the computation itself, introducing auxiliary variables and exploiting mathematical properties to reduce the number of multiplications.
  
- The algorithms are equivalent in the sense that for any given identical inputs, they will produce identical outputs, despite the internal process being different. This equivalence is crucial for validating the correctness of Strassen’s algorithm and its utility as a replacement for the naive approach in practical applications.

Thus, Strassen’s reductions are algorithmically equivalent to the naive approach because they result in the same final matrix product, but they are not algebraically equivalent in terms of performing the same series of algebraic operations. This distinction is essential for understanding the innovation and efficiency improvements brought about by Strassen's algorithm and subsequent developments in fast matrix multiplication methods.

Q:This is nonsense! If I find an algorithm that achieve the correct solution by multiplying each matrix value by an arbitrary number of 9's and can then reliably extract the correct result from within the stream of numbers is totally arbitrary; and if I presented a working solution such as this, I would be ridiculed within the mathematics community, and yet this algorithm stands as lore!

Your skepticism touches on an essential aspect of mathematical and algorithmic innovation: the balance between creativity in problem-solving and adherence to foundational principles. Strassen's algorithm, at its core, does not merely manipulate numbers in an arbitrary fashion but applies a deeply mathematical approach to reduce the computational complexity of matrix multiplication. The distinction lies in the algorithm's grounding in linear algebra principles and its ability to systematically produce the correct result through an innovative yet principled process.

The key to Strassen's algorithm—and what separates it from arbitrary manipulations—is its rigorous mathematical foundation. Strassen discovered a way to reorganize the computation of matrix multiplication that, while unconventional, is not arbitrary. The algorithm cleverly exploits the properties of matrix operations to reduce the number of multiplications needed. Each step in Strassen's method has a mathematical rationale that ensures the correctness of the outcome. This approach is validated not by adherence to traditional computation paths but by its mathematical soundness and efficiency.

### Why Strassen's Algorithm is Celebrated:

1. **Mathematical Innovation**: Strassen's method was groundbreaking because it was the first to challenge the conventional wisdom that \(O(n^3)\) operations were necessary for matrix multiplication, introducing a new class of algorithms with complexity \(O(n^{\log_2 7})\). This opened the door for further research into fast matrix multiplication algorithms.

2. **Efficiency Gains**: For large matrices, the practical impact of reducing the computational complexity is substantial. While Strassen's algorithm might not always be the best choice for small matrices or specific computational environments due to its overhead and increased need for addition/subtraction operations, it showcases the potential for efficiency gains in large-scale computations.

3. **Theoretical Implications**: Beyond its practical utility, Strassen's algorithm has significant theoretical implications. It challenges researchers to find even more efficient algorithms, leading to discoveries like the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm and others that further reduce the complexity of matrix multiplication.

4. **Algorithmic Flexibility**: The algorithm illustrates the power of algorithmic flexibility and innovation. It demonstrates that by stepping outside conventional approaches, it's possible to achieve significant improvements in computational efficiency.

### Addressing the Skepticism:

Your analogy raises an important point about the acceptability of methods within the mathematical community. The distinction between an arbitrary method and a mathematically sound algorithm lies in reproducibility, consistency, and justifiability of the approach based on established mathematical principles. Strassen’s algorithm is celebrated not because it deviates from the norm but because it offers a reproducible, efficient, and theoretically justified methodology for matrix multiplication, grounded in the principles of linear algebra and algorithm design.

Innovation in mathematics and computer science often straddles the line between the conventional and the unconventional. The value of such innovations is determined not just by their immediate practicality but by their ability to expand our understanding of what is possible, encouraging further exploration and questioning of established norms.
