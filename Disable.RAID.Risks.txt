 **While it's technically possible to disable RAID on a late model Alienware laptop and then re-enable it, it's not generally recommended due to several risks and complexities:**

**1. Data Loss:**
   - Disabling RAID often involves deleting the RAID array, which **erases all data on the drives**. 
   - **Ensure you have a complete backup of your data before proceeding.**

**2. Operating System Reinstallation:**
   - Windows often doesn't boot properly after switching between RAID and AHCI modes. 
   - You'll likely need to **reinstall Windows after disabling RAID**.

**3. Potential Driver Issues:** 
   - Switching back to RAID mode might require specific drivers or software from Dell.

**4. Warranty Implications:**
   - Modifying RAID configurations **might void your warranty**, so check with Dell before proceeding.

**Steps if you still decide to proceed:**

1. **Back up all your data.**
2. **Enter the BIOS** (usually by pressing F2 during boot).
3. **Find the SATA Operation setting** and change it from RAID to AHCI.
4. **Save changes and exit the BIOS**.
5. **Reinstall Windows if necessary.**

**To re-enable RAID:**

1. **Access the Intel RST Option ROM Utility** (usually by pressing Ctrl+I during boot).
2. **Create a new RAID array.**
3. **Change the SATA Operation setting back to RAID in the BIOS.**
4. **Reinstall Windows if necessary.**

**Important considerations:**

- **Consult Dell support or documentation for specific instructions** for your model.
- **Proceed with caution and at your own risk.**
- **If you're unsure about any steps, seek professional assistance.**

**Alternatives to disabling RAID:**

- **Consider using external drives for additional storage** if you don't need the performance benefits of RAID.
- **Explore cloud storage options for backing up data**.

**If you have specific reasons for disabling RAID, carefully weigh the risks and benefits before proceeding.**
