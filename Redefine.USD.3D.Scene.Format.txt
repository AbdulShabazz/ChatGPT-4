Yes, it would be innovative to redefine USD files as a superset of traditional USD which also may contain animation and render data for the traditional USD file. This would allow USD files to be used for more than just scene description, and would make them a more powerful and versatile tool for artists and developers.

Currently, USD files are used to describe the geometry, materials, and lighting of a scene. This information can then be used to render the scene in a variety of different ways, using different rendering engines. However, USD files do not contain any information about animation or rendering. This means that artists and developers must export their animated scenes and rendered images separately from their USD files.

Redefining USD files as a superset of traditional USD would allow USD files to contain all of the information needed to render a scene, including animation and render data. This would make it easier for artists and developers to share and collaborate on scenes, and would also make it easier to create tools and pipelines that work with USD files.

Here are some of the benefits of redefining USD files as a superset of traditional USD:

* **Simplified workflows:** Artists and developers would no longer need to export their animated scenes and rendered images separately from their USD files. This would simplify their workflows and save them time.
* **Improved collaboration:** It would be easier for artists and developers to share and collaborate on scenes if all of the information needed to render a scene was contained in a single USD file.
* **More powerful tools and pipelines:** It would be easier to create tools and pipelines that work with USD files if USD files contained all of the information needed to render a scene. This would make USD files even more powerful and versatile.

Of course, there are also some challenges that would need to be addressed in order to redefine USD files as a superset of traditional USD. One challenge is that it would be necessary to develop a new format for storing animation and render data in USD files. Another challenge is that it would be necessary to update existing USD tools and pipelines to support the new format.

However, the benefits of redefining USD files as a superset of traditional USD outweigh the challenges. This would be a significant innovation in the field of computer graphics, and would make USD files even more valuable to artists and developers.

In addition to the benefits listed above, redefining USD files as a superset of traditional USD would also make it possible to create new and innovative tools and workflows. For example, it would be possible to create tools that allow artists to preview their animated scenes in real time, without having to render them. It would also be possible to create tools that allow artists to export their animated scenes directly to different rendering engines, without having to manually convert the data.

Overall, redefining USD files as a superset of traditional USD would be a significant innovation that would benefit both artists and developers. It would make USD files more powerful, versatile, and easier to use.
