Kostya Trachenko's work on the theory of liquids, especially in the context of phase transformations from a solid to a liquid, is quite advanced and involves the study of dynamic processes at the atomic or molecular level. Such transformations can be described by several parameters, including temperature, pressure, and specific material properties.

A general parametric equation for phase transformation, especially in theoretical physics and materials science, may not be presented as a simple, universal formula due to the complexity and variability of the factors involved. Instead, phase transitions are often described by models that account for the energy states of particles, the structure of the material, and external conditions.

In the context of Trachenko's work, one may encounter discussions of potential energy landscapes, configurational entropy, and the role of kinetic constraints in determining the phase of a material. These concepts can be mathematically modeled but often require numerical simulations or specific experimental data to provide meaningful equations for a particular material or condition.

If there's a specific model or equation you're looking for from Kostya Trachenko's book "Theory of Liquids" or related to his research on the matter phase transformation from solid to liquid, it would be helpful to have more context or a specific aspect of the theory you're interested in. This information would allow for a more targeted explanation or direction to further resources.
