**Q:** What constitutes a Youtube view, as defined by Youtube ?

**A:** According to YouTube's official Help Center, a view is counted when:

1. A viewer intentionally initiates the watching of a video.

2. The video is played for at least 30 seconds. If the video is shorter than 30 seconds, a view is counted when the video is played through to the end.

3. The video is played in an embedded player on another website, as long as the embedding is not considered playback in an unauthorized third-party player.

Some additional points:

- Repeated views count up to a certain point. If the same viewer watches a video multiple times, each viewing will be counted as a new view. However, the platform has systems in place to identify artificial repeat viewing and discounts those views to protect the integrity of the view count.

- YouTube doesn't count views from unauthorized third-party apps or websites that stream YouTube videos.

- Watching your own video does not increase the view count.

It's important to note that YouTube regularly audits the views for spam to ensure the accuracy of the view count. Views that are identified as spam are removed, which can cause the view count to decrease.

**Q:** What if the playback duration doesn't constitute any contiguous playback ?

**A:** YouTube's view counting system is more complex than simply measuring a contiguous 30-second playback. The platform uses a sophisticated algorithm to validate views and ensure they represent genuine user engagement.

If a viewer watches parts of a video multiple times, but the total watched time exceeds 30 seconds, it could still be counted as a view. For example, if a user watches the first 10 seconds, skips to the middle and watches another 10 seconds, then goes back and watches the last 10 seconds, it may be counted as a view even though the user did not watch 30 seconds continuously.

However, YouTube's system also checks for signs of artificial inflation of view counts. If a user repeatedly skips to different parts of a video and the behavior seems unnatural or bot-like, those views might be discounted.

The specifics of YouTube's algorithm are not public to prevent people from gaming the system. The general principle is that YouTube aims to count views that represent genuine user engagement while filtering out views that appear artificial or manipulated.

It's also worth noting that for the purposes of monetization and advertiser statistics, YouTube has additional metrics like "watch time" which measure the total time users spent watching a video, regardless of whether it counted as a "view" for public display.

**Q:** If my Youtube comments are auto deleted, is it because Youtube also allows some channels to invoke marketing settings which increase viewership ?

**A:** YouTube does offer some features and settings that channels can use to manage their presence on the platform and potentially increase viewership. However, the automatic deletion of comments is usually not directly related to these marketing settings.

Comments are typically auto-deleted or hidden due to YouTube's built-in spam filters and community guidelines enforcement. This may happen if:

1. The comment contains spam, self-promotion, or external links that YouTube's algorithm flags as potentially harmful.

2. The comment uses language that violates YouTube's community guidelines, such as hate speech, harassment, or profanity.

3. The channel owner has set up a blocked words list, and if your comment contains any of those blocked words, it will be automatically held for review or deleted.

4. The channel owner has enabled a setting that holds all comments for review before they are publicly visible.

While YouTube does provide tools for channels to promote their content and grow their audience, such as paid advertising, end screens, and cards, these marketing tools do not typically involve the automatic deletion of comments.

If you find that your comments are consistently being removed on a particular channel, it's best to review that channel's comment policy (if available) or reach out to the channel owner for clarification on why your comments are being deleted.
