**Q:** In headphone performance statistics, does lower impedance infer higher dB sensitivity ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** In general, there is a relationship between impedance and sensitivity in headphones, but it's not always a direct one-to-one correlation. Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. Impedance: This is the measure of the headphone's resistance to the electrical current flowing through it. It is measured in ohms (Ω). Headphones with lower impedance (typically under 50Ω) require less power to drive them to high volumes.

2. Sensitivity: This is a measure of how efficiently the headphones convert electrical signals into acoustic sound. It's typically measured in decibels of Sound Pressure Level per milliwatt (dB SPL/mW). Higher sensitivity means the headphones can produce louder sounds with less power input.

In many cases, headphones with lower impedance tend to have higher sensitivity. This is because lower impedance allows more current to flow through the driver, which can result in higher volume output for a given power input.

However, this relationship is not always direct, as sensitivity also depends on other factors like the design and materials of the driver, the size and shape of the earpiece, and the overall construction of the headphones.

Therefore, while lower impedance often suggests higher sensitivity, it's not a guaranteed relationship. It's always best to refer to the specifications provided by the manufacturer for accurate information on a specific headphone's impedance and sensitivity.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
