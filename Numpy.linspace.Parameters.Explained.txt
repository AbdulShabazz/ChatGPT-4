`np.linspace` is a function in NumPy, a Python library used for numerical computations. It generates an array of evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. The parameters for `np.linspace` are as follows:

1. **start**: 
   - Type: float or integer.
   - Description: The starting value of the sequence.

2. **stop**: 
   - Type: float or integer.
   - Description: The end value of the sequence. 

3. **num**: 
   - Type: integer.
   - Description: The number of evenly spaced samples to generate. Default is 50.

4. **endpoint**: 
   - Type: boolean, optional.
   - Description: If `True`, `stop` is the last sample. Otherwise, it is not included. Default is `True`.

5. **retstep**: 
   - Type: boolean, optional.
   - Description: If `True`, return (`samples`, `step`), where `step` is the spacing between samples. Default is `False`.

6. **dtype**: 
   - Type: dtype, optional.
   - Description: The type of the output array. If `dtype` is not given, the data type of the output array is inferred from the type of `start` and `stop`.

7. **axis**: 
   - Type: int, optional.
   - Description: The axis in the result to store the samples. Relevant only if start or stop are array-like. By default (0), the samples will be along a new axis inserted at the beginning. Use -1 to get an axis at the end.

`np.linspace` is commonly used for creating a set of points for plotting functions in a specified interval, or for generating a specific number of sample points for numerical computations.
