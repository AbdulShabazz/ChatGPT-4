Bard:

There are several more efficient ways to compare two audio file formants than with the use of a spectrogram. Spectrograms are computationally expensive to generate and can be difficult to interpret. Here are a few alternative methods:

* **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)**: MFCCs are a feature extraction technique that captures the spectral characteristics of an audio signal. They are more efficient to compute than spectrograms and are more robust to noise.

* **Linear prediction coefficients (LPCs)**: LPCs are another feature extraction technique that models the vocal tract of a speaker. They are particularly well-suited for formant analysis.

* **Perceptual linear prediction (PLP)**: PLP is an extension of LPC that takes into account the non-linearity of the human auditory system. It is more accurate than LPC for formant analysis.

* **Filter banks**: Filter banks are a more general approach to feature extraction that can be used to extract formant frequencies directly from an audio signal. They are often used in conjunction with other feature extraction techniques, such as MFCCs or LPCs.

The best method for comparing two audio file formants will depend on the specific application. However, in general, MFCCs, LPCs, PLP, and filter banks are all more efficient and accurate than spectrograms.

Here is a table that summarizes the pros and cons of each method:

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| Spectrograms | Easy to interpret | Computationally expensive |
| MFCCs | More efficient than spectrograms, robust to noise | Less accurate than LPCs or PLP |
| LPCs | Very accurate for formant analysis | Less robust to noise than MFCCs |
| PLP | More accurate than LPCs for formant analysis | More computationally expensive than LPCs |
| Filter banks | Can be used to extract formant frequencies directly from an audio signal | Can be less accurate than MFCCs, LPCs, or PLP |
