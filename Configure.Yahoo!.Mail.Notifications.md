To configure Yahoo! Mail on your iOS device so that it shows notification tallies (or badge app icons) on the home screen icon, follow these steps:

1. **Open Settings**: On your iPhone, open the "Settings" app.

2. **Go to Notifications**: Scroll down and tap on "Notifications".

3. **Select Yahoo! Mail**: Scroll through the list of apps until you find Yahoo! Mail and tap on it.

4. **Enable Badge App Icon**: Make sure the "Badge App Icon" toggle is turned on. This setting allows the app icon to display a number indicating the count of unread messages.

5. **Adjust Notification Settings**: While you're in the Yahoo! Mail notifications settings, you can also adjust other notification preferences, such as the style of alerts (None, Banners, or Alerts) and sounds, according to your preference.

After enabling the badge app icon, you should see a red badge with a number on the Yahoo! Mail app icon whenever there are unread emails. If you don't see the changes reflected, try restarting your device or ensuring that the app is updated to the latest version.

If the notification tallies (badge app icons) still aren't showing on your Yahoo! Mail app on iOS after configuring the settings, there are several potential reasons and solutions you can explore:

1. **Check Notification Settings in Yahoo! Mail App**: Sometimes, the app itself has additional notification settings. Open Yahoo! Mail, go to its settings, and check if there are any specific options for enabling notifications or badge counts that might be turned off.

2. **Ensure Background App Refresh is Enabled**: iOS needs to allow apps to refresh their content in the background to update notification badges accurately. Go to **Settings** -> **General** -> **Background App Refresh** and make sure it is turned on for Yahoo! Mail.

3. **Update the App and iOS**: Ensure that both your app and your iOS are up to date. Updates can fix bugs related to notifications and improve compatibility. Check for any available updates in the App Store for Yahoo! Mail and in **Settings** -> **General** -> **Software Update** for iOS.

4. **Check Network Connection**: A stable internet connection is required for the app to retrieve new emails and update the badge count. Ensure your device is connected to a reliable Wi-Fi or cellular network.

5. **Reinstall the App**: Sometimes, removing and reinstalling an app can resolve persistent issues. Try deleting Yahoo! Mail and then installing it again from the App Store.

6. **Check Focus Settings**: iOS allows you to set up Focus modes which can restrict notifications. Make sure that your Focus settings are not blocking notifications from Yahoo! Mail. Check this in **Settings** -> **Focus**.

7. **Reset Notification Settings**: If none of the above steps work, you can reset all system settings, including notification settings. Go to **Settings** -> **General** -> **Reset** -> **Reset All Settings**. This wonâ€™t delete your apps or data but will reset system settings to their defaults, which might resolve any misconfigurations.

If after trying these steps the issue still persists, it might be a good idea to contact Yahoo! support or check online forums for any similar issues faced by other users that might have specific solutions.
