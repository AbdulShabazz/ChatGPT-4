**Q:** When employing a Sell On The News options trading strategy, should I sell my options for a profit when Tesla firsts announces a rumored robo taxi unveil in August or is it more profitable to sell after the event or perhaps after they begin deliveries of the rumored robo taxis ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** When considering a "Sell on the News" options trading strategy for Tesla's rumored robo taxi unveil, there are several factors to weigh:

1. Selling before the event:
Pros:
- You capitalize on the anticipation and hype leading up to the announcement.
- You avoid the risk of disappointment if the announcement doesn't meet expectations.

Cons:
- You might miss out on potential gains if the announcement exceeds expectations.

2. Selling after the event:
Pros:
- You can assess the market's reaction to the actual announcement.
- If the announcement is well-received, you might see a short-term spike in stock price.

Cons:
- There's a risk of "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, where the stock price drops immediately after the announcement.

3. Selling after deliveries begin:
Pros:
- You could benefit from long-term value creation if the robo taxi service is successful.
- Real-world performance data might boost investor confidence.

Cons:
- This is a much longer-term play, which may not align with the typical "Sell on the News" strategy.
- There's increased risk of other market factors affecting the stock price over this extended period.

Generally, the "Sell on the News" strategy often involves selling just before or immediately after the news event. In this case, that would mean selling either just before the August unveil or shortly after.

The most profitable approach depends on your risk tolerance, market conditions, and your assessment of Tesla's ability to meet or exceed expectations. It's also worth noting that options have time decay, so holding them for an extended period (like waiting for deliveries) may not be ideal unless you're using LEAPS.

Remember, this is a speculative strategy based on rumors. It's crucial to do thorough research, consider your personal financial situation, and possibly consult with a financial advisor before making any trading decisions.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
