Notes:

Burson 3X Product Lines are for single-ended audio

Burson 3X GT Product Lines are for balanced audio

Burson Timekeeper 3X GT are (per channel) mono block appliance pairs intended to drive floor speakers. The Burson Timekeeper 3X GT are not volume controlled so a pre-amp unit- or a volume control equivalent, is required in the source chain to provide volume control

The Burson Conductor 3X GT signal feeds into the Burson Soloist [Voyager] 3X GT
