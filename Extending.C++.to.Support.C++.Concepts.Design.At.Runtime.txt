What language level extensions are required for C++ to support the introduction of concepts into the language by the programmer if they did not exist in the standard?

ChatGPT:

Introducing a feature like concepts into C++ without direct language support is a challenging endeavor. The C++ language, prior to the introduction of "concepts" in C++20, didn't offer any built-in mechanisms for directly expressing constraints on template parameters in the same way that concepts do. However, if you were to try and emulate this feature in older C++ versions, here's a rough outline of what you might need:

    Type Traits and Static Assertions:
        Before C++20, one of the common ways to enforce constraints on template types was by using type traits and static assertions.

        cpp

    template<typename T>
    void function(T t) {
        static_assert(std::is_integral<T>::value, "T must be an integral type");
        // function implementation
    }

SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error):

    This is a principle in C++ template metaprogramming where a failed substitution of a template parameter is not considered an error.
    With SFINAE, you can "disable" specific template overloads or specializations when certain conditions are not met.

    cpp

    template<
        typename T,
        typename = std::enable_if_t<std::is_integral<T>::value>
    >
    void function(T t) {
        // function implementation
    }

Expression SFINAE:

    This allows you to check for the validity of certain expressions, ensuring they compile. This can be used to enforce more intricate constraints.

    cpp

        template<typename T>
        auto function(T t) -> decltype(t + t, void()) {
            // function implementation
        }

    Tag Dispatching:
        Another approach involves overloading functions based on type traits, allowing you to "dispatch" to the right function based on type properties.

    Clear Documentation:
        Without native concept support, clearly documenting constraints on template parameters becomes even more crucial. Users of the template need to know what types are supported.

    Possible Language Extensions:
        To truly introduce a concept-like feature, you'd likely need deep compiler integration, and you would have to define new syntax and semantics that integrate seamlessly with the rest of the language.
        Such a task would be non-trivial and might require a lot of effort, akin to building a new compiler or forking an existing one.

In summary, while there are ways to enforce constraints on templates in pre-C++20 using techniques like SFINAE, static_assert, and others, they are not as elegant, straightforward, or powerful as the concepts feature introduced in C++20. If you desire concept-like functionality, it's recommended to use a C++20 or newer compliant compiler.

I want a framework which supports the addition of concepts by the developer to allow them to develop other useful features like concepts which are not currently in the standard.

ChatGPT:

If you're looking for a framework to extend the C++ language to introduce new language-level features like "concepts" or other similar innovations, then you're venturing into the realm of language tooling, compilers, and language front-ends. This is no small task. Nevertheless, here's a general approach and some tools that might be helpful:

    Clang & LLVM:
        Clang is a compiler front-end for the C, C++, and Objective-C programming languages, using LLVM as its back-end. Because of its modular design, it's often used in research and experimental projects to introduce new language features or extend existing ones.
        You could fork Clang and start experimenting with adding your own language features.

    GCC Plugins:
        The GCC compiler has a plugin framework that allows developers to add functionality to the compiler. This could be used to experiment with new language features, although it might not be as flexible as modifying a compiler's front-end directly.

    Metaprogramming Libraries:
        Libraries like Boost.Hana allow for advanced metaprogramming in C++. While they don't let you introduce new language-level features, they might allow for powerful abstractions that can emulate some of the behavior you're looking for.

    External Tools:
        You could build an external tool that preprocesses your code, adding in your new features, and then outputs standard C++ code. This tool would act as a middleman between your code with its custom features and the standard C++ compiler.
        This approach has the advantage of being compiler-agnostic but comes with the challenge of building a robust preprocessor tool.

    Documentation & Conventions:
        Regardless of the approach, if you introduce new features or concepts, ensure they are well-documented so other developers can understand and use them.

    Consider the Community:
        Before venturing deep into creating a new language extension, it might be worth discussing your ideas with the C++ community. They could provide valuable feedback, and there might be interest in collaborating.

    Stay Updated:
        The C++ language is continuously evolving, with new features proposed and discussed in the C++ standards committee. Your desired feature might already be under discussion or development for future standards.

In summary, while introducing new language-level features is a massive undertaking that typically requires a deep understanding of compilers and language design, there are tools and frameworks out there that can help. Remember, though, that making changes at the language level can have a broad range of implications, so thorough testing and validation will be crucial.
