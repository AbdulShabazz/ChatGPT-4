There is no evidence that tooth plaque, once it's dissolved by mouthwash and ingested into the body, can block your arteries.

Tooth plaque is a sticky film of bacteria, food particles, and saliva that forms on teeth. If plaque is not removed regularly, it can harden into tartar, which can irritate the gums and lead to gum disease. Gum disease is a serious infection that can damage the gums and bones that support the teeth.

Research has shown that people with gum disease are more likely to have heart disease and stroke. However, it is not clear whether gum disease causes heart disease or if they are both caused by the same underlying factors, such as inflammation.

Some studies have suggested that bacteria from the mouth can enter the bloodstream and travel to the arteries, where they can contribute to plaque buildup. However, more research is needed to confirm this.

Mouthwash can help to remove plaque and bacteria from the mouth. However, mouthwash is not a substitute for brushing and flossing. It is important to brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes each time and floss once a day to remove plaque and bacteria from between your teeth.

If you are concerned about your risk of heart disease, it is important to talk to your doctor. They can assess your risk factors and recommend ways to reduce your risk.

Here are some tips for maintaining good oral health:

* Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes each time.
* Floss once a day.
* Use a fluoride toothpaste.
* Eat a healthy diet.
* Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.
* See your dentist for regular checkups and cleanings.
