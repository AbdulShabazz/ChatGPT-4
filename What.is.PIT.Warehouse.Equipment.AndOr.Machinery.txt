Powered Industrial Trucks (PIT) refer to a broad range of mobile equipment used in warehousing and material handling environments. These vehicles are employed for moving, raising, or lowering loads and include various types of machinery designed for a multitude of tasks related to the storage, retrieval, and transportation of goods. The following provides an overview of common types of PIT equipment, their specifications, and applications:

1. **Forklifts**
   - *Capacity*: Typically ranges from 3,000 to 36,000 pounds.
   - *Lift Height*: Varies widely, can reach up to 36 feet or more.
   - *Type*: Includes counterbalance, reach, telescopic handler, and industrial forklifts.
   - *Power Source*: Electric battery or internal combustion (diesel, propane, natural gas).
   - *Application*: Used for loading and unloading goods, stacking pallets, and horizontal transport.

2. **Order Pickers**
   - *Capacity*: Generally between 1,000 and 5,000 pounds.
   - *Lift Height*: Typically up to 32 feet.
   - *Type*: Includes mid-level and high-level order pickers.
   - *Power Source*: Almost exclusively electric battery-powered.
   - *Application*: Used for picking and handling items at various heights in warehouse racking systems.

3. **Pallet Jacks (Pallet Trucks)**
   - *Capacity*: Usually around 3,000 to 8,000 pounds.
   - *Lift Height*: Relatively low, often just enough to clear the floor (few inches).
   - *Type*: Manual and powered versions available.
   - *Power Source*: Manual or electric battery for powered pallet jacks.
   - *Application*: Used for horizontal transportation and positioning of pallets within a warehouse.

4. **Stackers**
   - *Capacity*: Ranges from 1,000 to 5,000 pounds.
   - *Lift Height*: Can lift loads to a height of up to 16 feet.
   - *Type*: Manual, semi-electric, and fully electric stackers.
   - *Power Source*: Human power for manual stackers and electric battery for semi/fully electric models.
   - *Application*: Ideal for stacking pallets and transporting relatively light loads over short distances.

5. **Reach Trucks**
   - *Capacity*: Typically between 2,500 and 5,500 pounds.
   - *Lift Height*: Can reach up to 30 feet or more.
   - *Type*: Stand-up trucks are common for narrow-aisle work; double-deep reach trucks for multiple pallet loads.
   - *Power Source*: Primarily electric battery-powered.
   - *Application*: Designed for warehouse operations that require reaching out to pick or place pallets at depth in racking systems.

6. **Tow Tractors (Tuggers)**
   - *Capacity*: Towing capacity up to 50,000 pounds or more.
   - *Type*: Walk-behind and ride-on versions available.
   - *Power Source*: Electric battery or internal combustion.
   - *Application*: Used for towing carts or trailers filled with materials through a warehouse or facility.

7. **Personnel and Burden Carriers**
   - *Capacity*: Can carry a few passengers to several hundred pounds of materials.
   - *Speed*: Capable of speeds up to 15 mph, though often less within warehouse settings.
   - *Power Source*: Usually electric battery-powered.
   - *Application*: Used for transporting personnel, equipment, or light loads over large distances within a facility.

Safety and Operational Standards:

- PIT operations are subject to standards and regulations by bodies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, which requires operators to undergo proper training and certification.
- Equipment often includes safety features such as backup alarms, flashing lights, seat belts, and systems for stability and load handling.

Maintenance and Inspection:

- Regular maintenance schedules are critical to ensure safe operation, typically involving daily inspections and periodic services, including battery care for electric models, and engine maintenance for those with internal combustion engines.

The selection of specific PIT machinery for a warehouse will depend on several factors, including the nature of the materials being handled, the layout of the warehouse, the volume of goods, and the specific tasks that need to be accomplished. It is crucial for warehouses to employ the right mix of equipment to optimize workflow, enhance productivity, and maintain a safe working environment.
