**Q:** How do you dismiss an incoming phone call in iOS ?

**A:** To dismiss an incoming phone call on iOS, you have a few different options depending on the scenario:

### 1. **When Your iPhone is Unlocked:**
   - **Decline Button:** You'll see the "Decline" and "Answer" buttons on the screen. Tap the "Decline" button to dismiss the call.

### 2. **When Your iPhone is Locked:**
   - **Power Button:** Press the power (side) button twice quickly. This will reject the call.
   - **Volume Button:** On some older iPhones, pressing the power button once will silence the call (but not reject it), while pressing it twice will reject the call.

### 3. **Using Earphones or AirPods:**
   - **AirPods:** Double-tap the AirPods (if supported) to reject the call.
   - **Earphones:** Press and hold the center button on the earphones for a couple of seconds until you hear a beep to reject the call.

### 4. **Using Siri:**
   - You can also say, "Hey Siri, decline the call," to dismiss the incoming call.

These methods allow you to manage incoming calls whether you're actively using your phone or it's locked.
