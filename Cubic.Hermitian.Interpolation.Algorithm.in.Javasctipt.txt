For high-quality artificial speech synthesis, incorporating an ease-in ease-out interpolation can help in adjusting pitch, volume, or timing to make the speech sound more natural and expressive. This kind of interpolation, also known as "smoothstep" interpolation, can be very useful in scenarios where you want to gradually start and stop certain effects or transitions, mimicking the natural ebb and flow of human speech.

The algorithm I'll provide below uses a cubic Hermite interpolator, which is a common choice for smoothstep functions. This method ensures that both the value and the first derivative (the rate of change) are continuous across the interpolation boundary, which is essential for avoiding abrupt changes that can sound unnatural.

Here's a JavaScript implementation of a cubic Hermite interpolator with ease-in and ease-out characteristics:

```javascript
/**
 * Performs cubic Hermite interpolation between two values bound within an interval.
 * 
 * @param {number} t - The interpolation factor, ranging from 0.0 (start) to 1.0 (end).
 * @param {number} p0 - The starting value of the interpolation (at t=0).
 * @param {number} p1 - The ending value of the interpolation (at t=1).
 * @param {number} m0 - The tangent (slope) at the starting point.
 * @param {number} m1 - The tangent (slope) at the ending point.
 * @returns {number} - The interpolated value.
 */
function cubicHermite(t, p0, p1, m0, m1) {
    const t2 = t * t;
    const t3 = t2 * t;
    return (2 * t3 - 3 * t2 + 1) * p0 + (t3 - 2 * t2 + t) * m0 + (-2 * t3 + 3 * t2) * p1 + (t3 - t2) * m1;
}

/**
 * Calculates a smooth transition between 0 and 1 using a smoothstep interpolation.
 * This function can be used to apply ease-in and ease-out effects to your values.
 * 
 * @param {number} x - The input value for which to calculate the smoothstep, typically time or a normalized parameter.
 * @param {number} min - The lower bound of the input range.
 * @param {number} max - The upper bound of the input range.
 * @returns {number} - The smoothly interpolated value between 0 and 1.
 */
function smoothStep(x, min, max) {
    if (x <= min) return 0;
    if (x >= max) return 1;
    x = (x - min) / (max - min);
    return cubicHermite(x, 0, 1, 0, 0);
}
```

### How to Use This for Speech Synthesis

- **Timing Adjustments**: Use `smoothStep` to adjust the speed of speech at the beginning and end of sentences or phrases, making the speech sound more natural.
- **Pitch Adjustments**: Apply the interpolation to pitch variations, gently easing in and out of pitch changes to avoid abrupt shifts that can sound mechanical.
- **Volume Adjustments**: Modify the volume over time, especially useful for emphasizing certain words or phrases or for mimicking the natural variations in human speech intensity.

Since you mentioned that runtime performance is not a factor, this algorithm prioritizes the quality of the interpolation effect over computational efficiency. However, even though it's not optimized for real-time use, the cubic Hermite interpolation provides a high-quality, smooth transition that is suitable for offline processing where you can afford more computation time to achieve better results.
