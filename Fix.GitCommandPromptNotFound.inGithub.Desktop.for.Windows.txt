The issue of "git command prompt not found" in GitHub Desktop on Windows could be due to a variety of factors such as incorrect PATH configuration, incomplete or corrupted Git installation, or other software conflicts. To rectify the situation, you may proceed as follows:

### Preliminary Diagnostics

1. **Operating System Compatibility**: Ensure that the operating system is Windows 7 or later.
2. **System Architecture**: Verify if the system is 32-bit or 64-bit, as installation steps may differ based on the architecture.
3. **Current Installation**: Open "Add or Remove Programs" in Windows and check if Git is listed among the installed programs.

### Solutions

#### Option 1: Verify PATH Environment Variable

1. **Access Environment Variables**: Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables.
2. **Check PATH**: Examine the `PATH` variable under "System variables" to see if it includes the path to the Git binary.
    - **Expected Path**: Typically `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\cmd`.

#### Option 2: Reinstall Git

1. **Uninstall Current Version**: If Git is installed, uninstall it via "Add or Remove Programs".
2. **Download Latest Version**: Navigate to [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the appropriate version for your system architecture.
3. **Installation Configuration**: During installation, ensure that the option to add Git to PATH is selected.
4. **Verification**: Upon installation, open Command Prompt and execute `git --version` to ensure it is properly installed.

#### Option 3: Utilize GitHub Desktop's Bundled Git

1. **Open GitHub Desktop**: Launch the GitHub Desktop application.
2. **Navigate to Settings**: Open `File -> Options -> Advanced`.
3. **Git Executable**: Under the "Git" section, make sure the option for using the system Git is unchecked. This will utilize the Git executable bundled with GitHub Desktop.

#### Option 4: Manual PATH Update

1. **Locate Git Executable**: Find the location where Git is installed. The Git executable (`git.exe`) is usually found in `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\cmd`.
2. **Update PATH**: Append the Git executable path to the System Environment Variable `PATH`.
3. **Restart System**: Reboot the system to reflect the PATH changes.

### Verification Steps

1. **Command Prompt**: Open a new Command Prompt window and run `git --version`.
   - **Expected Output**: Git version should be displayed.
2. **GitHub Desktop**: Try to execute the previously failing operation within GitHub Desktop.
   - **Expected Behavior**: The operation should succeed without the "git command prompt not found" error.

By following these procedures, you should be able to effectively resolve the "git command prompt not found" issue in GitHub Desktop on a Windows system.
