 **While iOS doesn't have a built-in feature for temporary blocking, here are several effective ways to block a number not in your contacts:**

**1. Silence Unknown Callers:**

- This feature sends calls from numbers not in your contacts directly to voicemail, ensuring you're not disturbed by them.
- To enable it:
    - Go to **Settings > Phone**.
    - Toggle on **Silence Unknown Callers**.

**2. Use Do Not Disturb (DND):**

- Customize DND to silence all calls except those from specific contacts or groups.
- To configure it:
    - Go to **Settings > Focus > Do Not Disturb**.
    - Under **Allow Calls From**, select **All Contacts** or specific groups.
    - To temporarily activate DND, swipe down from the top right corner of your screen and tap on the crescent moon icon.

**3. Block the Number Directly:**

- If you want to block the number permanently, you can do so through the Phone app:
    - Open the **Phone app**.
    - Tap **Recents** or **Voicemail**.
    - Find the number you want to block.
    - Tap the **Info icon** (i) next to the number.
    - Scroll down and tap **Block this Caller**.
    - Confirm by tapping **Block Contact**.
    - To unblock later, go to **Settings > Phone > Blocked Contacts** and tap **Edit**.

**4. Use Third-Party Call Blocking Apps:**

- Consider apps like RoboKiller, Nomorobo, or Truecaller for more advanced blocking features, including temporary blocks:
    - These apps often offer scheduling options for temporary blocks.
    - They may also provide additional spam protection and caller ID features.

**Remember:**

- Silence Unknown Callers might not silence calls from numbers that Siri recently suggested or those you've called yourself.
- If you need temporary blocks frequently, third-party apps offer more flexibility.
- Choose the method that best suits your needs and preferences.
