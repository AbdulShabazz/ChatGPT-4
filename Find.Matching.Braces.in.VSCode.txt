Finding matching braces in VSCode is easy. You can use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + Shift + \\** on Windows and Linux, or **Cmd + Shift + \\** on Mac, to jump to the matching bracket or parenthesis of the current cursor position¹². This command works for square brackets, curly braces, and parentheses³.

You can also use the **editor.action.smartSelect.grow** command to select everything between the matching brackets or quotes⁴. The default keyboard shortcut for this command is **Shift + Alt + Right Arrow**. You can customize the keyboard shortcuts by going to **File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts** or by pressing **Ctrl + K, Ctrl + S**².

I hope this helps you with your coding. 😊
