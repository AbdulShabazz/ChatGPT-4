There isn't a single "standard spelling" for a 16-bit 44100 Hz PCM audio signal, as it can be represented in various formats depending on context and purpose. Here are some common ways it might be described:

**Technical format:**

* 16-bit PCM @ 44.1 kHz
* PCM 16/44.1
* 44.1 kHz, 16-bit audio
* Audio sample rate: 44.1 kHz, resolution: 16 bits

**Informal descriptions:**

* CD-quality audio
* Standard audio format
* Uncompressed 16-bit audio

The best way to describe it depends on your audience and the specific context. If you're writing for a technical audience, using the precise technical format like "16-bit PCM @ 44.1 kHz" is clear and unambiguous. If you're writing for a non-technical audience, using a more informal description like "CD-quality audio" might be more easily understood.

Here are some additional things to consider when describing the audio signal:

* **File format:** The audio data may be stored in various file formats like WAV, AIFF, FLAC, etc., which influence how the information is organized and encoded.
* **Channels:** Is it mono, stereo, or multi-channel audio?
* **Purpose:** Is it for music, speech, or a specific application?

By providing additional context and details, you can ensure your description of the audio signal is accurate and meaningful for your audience.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
