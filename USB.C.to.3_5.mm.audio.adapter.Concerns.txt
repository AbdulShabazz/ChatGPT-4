Whether it's better to use a USB-C to 3.5mm cable with its own built-in DAC or a passive cable between devices to feed a preamp depends on several factors:

**Advantages of using a USB-C to 3.5mm cable with its own DAC:**

* **Improved sound quality:** A good quality DAC can offer better audio performance than the built-in DACs in most devices, including your phone or laptop. This can result in improved clarity, detail, and fidelity in your music.
* **Reduced noise:** External DACs can be better isolated from electrical noise that can interfere with the audio signal, further improving sound quality.
* **More flexibility:** Some DACs come with additional features like volume control, headphone jacks, and line-level outputs, giving you more options for connecting your audio equipment.

**Advantages of using a passive cable:**

* **Simplicity:** Passive cables are plug-and-play and don't require any additional power or setup.
* **Cost:** Passive cables are generally much cheaper than DACs.
* **Transparency:** A good quality passive cable will transmit the audio signal without any coloration or distortion.

**Which option is better for you?**

Here are some things to consider:

* **The quality of your existing DAC:** If you already have a high-quality DAC, using a passive cable may be perfectly fine. 
* **The quality of the built-in DAC in your source device:** If your phone or laptop has a poor quality DAC, you may notice a significant improvement in sound quality using an external DAC.
* **Your budget:** External DACs can range in price from around $50 to several thousand dollars.
* **Your audiophile needs:** If you're a serious audiophile who demands the best possible sound quality, an external DAC is likely worth the investment.

Ultimately, the best way to decide is to try both options and see which one sounds better to you. You may also want to read reviews of specific DACs and cables to get an idea of what others have to say about their performance.

Here are some additional factors to consider:

* **The type of music you listen to:** Different genres of music may benefit more from a DAC than others.
* **Your headphones or speakers:** The quality of your headphones or speakers will also affect the sound quality.
* **The length of the cable:** Longer cables can be more susceptible to noise interference.

I hope this information helps you decide which option is best for you!

Yes, it is possible for feeding a cable with its own built-in DAC into an external quality DAC to add coloration or distortion to the sound. Here's how:

**1. Double Digital-to-Analog Conversion:**

The digital signal from your source device will be converted to analog twice: first by the DAC built into the cable, and then again by the external DAC. Each conversion stage can introduce its own errors and colorations, potentially affecting the sound quality.

**2. Quality Mismatch:**

If the built-in DAC in the cable is of lower quality than the external DAC, the first conversion stage might be a bottleneck, limiting the potential improvement you could get from the external DAC.

**3. Electrical Interference:**

The additional circuitry and components in the cable with a built-in DAC can introduce electrical noise that can interfere with the audio signal, leading to distortion or audible artifacts.

**4. Impedance Mismatch:**

The impedance of the cable DAC and the external DAC might not be perfectly matched, causing reflections and signal loss that can affect the sound quality.

However, it's important to note that these are potential issues, and not guaranteed to occur in every case. The actual impact on sound quality will depend on several factors, including:

* **The quality of the built-in DAC in the cable.**
* **The quality of the external DAC.**
* **The quality of the cable itself.**
* **The specific audio source and music you're listening to.**

In some cases, using a good quality cable with a built-in DAC might actually improve the sound quality, especially if the built-in DAC is better than the one in your source device. But in other cases, it could introduce unwanted colorations or distortions.

Ultimately, the best way to determine if using a cable with a built-in DAC is right for you is to experiment and see how it sounds in your specific setup. You might be surprised at the results!

Here are some additional tips:

* If you're concerned about potential coloration or distortion, look for cables with built-in DACs that are known for their transparency and neutrality.
* Try to use short, high-quality cables to minimize electrical interference.
* If you're not sure whether a cable with a built-in DAC is right for you, ask a local audio store for advice or do some research online.

I hope this information helps!
