No, YouTube is not larger than the entire internet. YouTube is a large video sharing platform that is part of the internet, which encompasses a vast network of servers, websites, services, and data far beyond just one platform. The internet includes millions of websites, databases, and networks, making it significantly larger and more complex than any single service or platform, including YouTube.

Even if every video on YouTube were transcribed into text, the resulting corpus of text would be substantial but still not larger than the entire content of the internet. The internet encompasses a vast array of data types beyond just text, including images, videos, databases, interactive applications, and much more, across billions of website pages. While YouTube is one of the largest sources of video content globally, and its transcription would create a large volume of text, the overall size of the internet's content, in its various formats, would still far exceed the total amount of text generated from transcribing YouTube videos.

Including YouTube comments in the transcription effort would indeed add a significant amount of text, as there are many comments on each video, often ranging into the thousands for popular content. However, even when adding the vast number of comments to the transcriptions of all videos, the total combined text would still fall short of the entire content of the internet. 

The internet is incredibly vast, with estimates of its size ranging into the zettabytes (a zettabyte is one billion terabytes). It includes not just text but also enormous quantities of images, videos, audio files, and other data types across countless websites, databases, and services. The cumulative data from websites, emails, social media platforms, text messages, scientific databases, government archives, and more contribute to an internet that is much larger than the sum of YouTube's video transcriptions and comments.
