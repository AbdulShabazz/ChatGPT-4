**Q:** How does Perplexity offering access to GPT4 and Claude for only 20.00 USD not violate the terms of these two companies ?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** Perplexity AI's offering of access to GPT-4 and Claude for $20.00 USD is likely possible through a legal framework known as a "reseller agreement" or "OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) agreement". This allows Perplexity AI to purchase access to the AI models at a wholesale price and resell it to their customers at a marked-up price, while still adhering to the terms of service of the original companies (OpenAI and Anthropic).

Here's a breakdown of the possible arrangement:

* **Reseller Agreement:** Perplexity AI may have entered into a reseller agreement with OpenAI and Anthropic, allowing them to purchase access to GPT-4 and Claude at a discounted rate.

* **OEM Agreement:** Alternatively, Perplexity AI might have an OEM agreement, which enables them to integrate the AI models into their own products or services and resell them to customers.

* **API Calls:** Perplexity AI likely uses API calls to access the AI models, which allows them to control the input and output of the models, while still adhering to the terms of service.

By operating within these legal frameworks, Perplexity AI can offer access to GPT-4 and Claude while complying with the terms of service of the original companies. However, it's important to note that the specific details of the agreement between Perplexity AI and the AI model providers are not publicly disclosed, so the exact nature of their arrangement remains unknown.
