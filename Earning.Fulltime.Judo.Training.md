   - **International Success**: Strong performances at international competitions, such as the European Championships, World Championships, or Grand Prix events, can raise an athlete's profile and attract sponsorships and support.

### 3. **Financial Support**
   - **Sponsorships**: Successful judoka may attract sponsorships from sports brands, companies, or local businesses, providing them with the financial resources to train full-time.
   - **Government Funding**: In many countries, the government provides funding to elite athletes through programs such as Olympic Solidarity or national sports agencies. This funding often covers living expenses, coaching, and travel for competitions.

   - **Professional Judo Teams**: In some countries, especially Japan and France, professional judo teams or clubs exist. Athletes on these teams often receive a salary, allowing them to focus on training.

### 5. **Olympic Qualification**
   - **Qualification Events**: Judoka must perform well in Olympic qualification events to earn enough points to qualify for the Olympics. This often requires extensive travel and competition, necessitating full-time training.
   - **National Selection**: In addition to earning qualification points, judoka must also be selected by their national federation to represent their country at the Olympics. National rankings and head-to-head performance are often factors in this decision.

### 6. **Dedication and Personal Sacrifices**
   - **Lifestyle Commitment**: Full-time training requires a significant personal commitment. Many athletes make sacrifices in other areas of their lives, such as education, employment, and personal relationships, to focus on their judo careers.
   - **Continuous Improvement**: To maintain their status as full-time athletes, judoka must continuously improve and adapt their training to stay competitive at the highest levels.

### 7. **Support Network**
   - **Coaches and Mentors**: Access to experienced coaches and mentors is critical. These individuals help athletes refine their techniques, develop strategies, and maintain the psychological resilience needed for high-level competition.
   - **Medical and Psychological Support**: Full-time athletes often have access to sports medicine professionals, physiotherapists, and sports psychologists who help them maintain peak physical and mental condition.

By excelling in these areas, judoka can secure the necessary resources and opportunities to train full-time, ultimately allowing them to compete at the Olympic level.
