**Q:** Define LASER and MASER!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**A:** LASER and MASER are acronyms that stand for:

LASER: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
MASER: Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation

Both are devices that emit coherent electromagnetic radiation through a process called stimulated emission. The main difference between the two is the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation they emit.

1. LASER: A laser emits light in the visible, ultraviolet, or infrared spectrum. It produces a highly focused, narrow beam of light with a specific wavelength. Lasers are used in various applications, such as optical storage devices (CD, DVD), fiber-optic communication, laser surgery, and laser cutting and welding.

2. MASER: A maser emits microwave radiation, which has a longer wavelength compared to visible light. Masers were developed before lasers and have fewer practical applications. They are primarily used in atomic clocks, radio telescopes, and some medical treatments.

Both lasers and masers work on the same principle of stimulated emission, where an incoming photon interacts with an excited atom or molecule, causing it to release a second photon with the same frequency, phase, and direction as the original photon. This process amplifies the light or microwave radiation, resulting in a coherent and focused beam.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
