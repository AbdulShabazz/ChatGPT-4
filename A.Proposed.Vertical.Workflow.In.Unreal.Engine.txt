Q:

Instead of a horizontal workflow in the Unreal Engine 3D graphics game engine for 3D game design, such as AActor objects, instances of AActor objects, animations; sound- and VFX; and Blueprints and or C++ for everything else... Why not configure Unreal Engine to support a vertical pipelined workflow where every AActor has zero or more AActors, zero or more AActor instances, zero or more animations, zero or more animations, zero or more sound- and VFX and finally zero or more Blueprints and or C++ per AActor, such that manipulating for example a cloud AActor in a scene separates its logic down to every level including the source code. Thereby, allowing a game designer to start at the highest level (the scene) and design downwards, as required.

ChatGPT:

The proposed vertical pipelined workflow seems to be a hierarchical, self-contained model, where each AActor and its associated elements (child AActors, instances, animations, sound effects, visual effects, and scripts) would act as a sort of "package". It's an interesting concept and has its merits, primarily in terms of organization, logical separation of elements and potentially more intuitive and flexible design and development process.

However, there are a few reasons why this might not be immediately achievable or practical with the current Unreal Engine, or why it may not be adopted:

    Technical limitations: Unreal Engine (as of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021) is not designed to work this way. It would likely require significant changes to the underlying architecture to support this model, which could introduce a lot of complexity and potential for bugs. This isn't to say it's impossible, but it would be a large undertaking.

    Performance implications: Having so many nested elements could lead to performance issues, especially in complex scenes with many actors. This is because every time an AActor is accessed, all of its associated elements would potentially need to be loaded as well, which could be a significant drain on resources.

    Workflow implications: While the proposed model could be more intuitive for some developers, others might find it overly complex or restrictive. It could also make collaboration more difficult, as changes to one AActor could have far-reaching effects on all its associated elements. Additionally, it could limit the reuse of assets, as each AActor and its associated elements would be closely tied together.

    Compatibility issues: Changing the workflow could lead to compatibility issues with existing projects or plugins. It would also require substantial documentation and learning resources to help developers transition to the new model.

Overall, the idea you've proposed is intriguing and could potentially offer some benefits over the existing workflow. However, it would likely require significant changes to Unreal Engine's architecture, which could introduce new complexities and challenges. As such, it would need to be carefully evaluated to determine if the potential benefits outweigh the risks and challenges.

Q:

What if the entire workflow were performed atop a machine learning model which could readily decompile the assets into its components and later rebuild them up in order achieve desirable runtime performance characteristics... ? 

ChatGPT:

Applying machine learning (ML) to automate and optimize game development processes is a burgeoning field, and it's feasible to consider using ML for the complex task of decomposing and recomposing game assets. It could potentially assist in optimizing runtime performance and could also allow for more intuitive, hierarchical structuring of game assets.

However, it's worth noting that this would be a highly complex task, as the ML model would need to understand and effectively manipulate many aspects of game design. This includes everything from 3D models and animations to sound and visual effects to scripting in both Blueprint and C++, each of which presents its own unique challenges.

Here are some potential obstacles to consider:

    Decomposition and recomposition: The ML model would need to be able to accurately decompose game assets into their constituent parts, modify them as needed, and then recompose them without losing any critical data or functionality. This would be a non-trivial task, requiring sophisticated understanding of the game assets.

    Optimization: It's one thing to decompose and recompose game assets, but doing so in a way that optimizes runtime performance is another matter entirely. This would likely require reinforcement learning or some form of model that can understand and optimize complex performance metrics.

    Training data: To train such a model, you would need a large amount of training data, likely in the form of pre-existing games or game assets. Gathering this data could be a challenge in itself, particularly when it comes to more complex assets.

    Computational resources: Training and using a machine learning model of this complexity would require significant computational resources, which could make it impractical for smaller development teams or individuals.

    Integration: Integrating this ML model into the Unreal Engine workflow would likely be a significant undertaking, requiring changes to both the engine's underlying architecture and its user interface.

That said, despite the challenges, the potential benefits could be significant. If successful, an ML model like this could potentially revolutionize the game development process, allowing for more intuitive design, improved performance, and even real-time, ML-driven game asset optimization.

The intersection of machine learning and game development is an exciting field, and it's likely that we'll continue to see innovative applications of ML in this area in the years to come.

Q:

What could Epic Games do to cultivate the source examples to train their models for the Unreal Engine?

ChatGPT:

If Epic Games wanted to cultivate source examples to train machine learning models for Unreal Engine, there are a variety of strategies they could employ:

    Internal Resources: Epic Games could use their own games as training data. Games developed by Epic, such as Fortnite, have a wealth of assets and could serve as an excellent starting point for training models.

    Community Contributions: Epic could encourage its large community of developers to contribute assets for training purposes. This could be done voluntarily or through competitions, where developers are incentivized to create and submit high-quality assets.

    Partnerships: Epic could partner with other game studios to share or exchange assets for training purposes. These partnerships could be mutually beneficial, especially if both companies are interested in leveraging machine learning.

    Synthetic Data Generation: They can use procedural generation techniques or even existing AI technologies to create a variety of synthetic datasets, including varied game scenarios, character models, environments, and more.

    Publicly Available Datasets: There are various publicly available datasets, including 3D models, animations, sounds, and other game-related data, that Epic Games could leverage for initial model training.

    Marketplace Data: Epic Games could also use assets from the Unreal Engine Marketplace for training. This could involve some legal and privacy considerations, so they would need to ensure they have the necessary permissions from the creators of these assets.

    Crowdsourcing: Through gamified initiatives, they could leverage the power of crowdsourcing. They could design a platform where game enthusiasts can contribute by creating or modifying game assets, and these assets could then be used to train the machine learning models.

It's important to note that when using any of these sources, data privacy and intellectual property rights need to be carefully considered and respected. Any use of data should be in compliance with applicable laws and agreements.

Once they've gathered the training data, the next step would be to preprocess and annotate it as necessary, then use it to train their machine learning models. This would likely involve a significant amount of work in terms of data cleaning and formatting, as well as potentially developing new tools or techniques to handle the unique challenges posed by game assets. However, with enough high-quality data, it could be possible to train a machine learning model to handle a wide variety of tasks within the Unreal Engine workflow.

Q:

Could they offer to market the games of game developers for one year, or offer them mega grants in return for the source code for these games?

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, Epic Games could definitely negotiate deals with game developers to access their source code in exchange for marketing services, financial support like MegaGrants, or other beneficial arrangements. This could provide a wealth of diverse and high-quality data to help train their machine learning models.

However, there are several factors to consider in such arrangements:

    Intellectual Property Rights: Game source code is a valuable asset, and many developers might be reluctant to share it. Epic Games would need to assure developers that their intellectual property would be respected and protected.

    Confidentiality and Privacy: Some developers might have concerns about the confidentiality of their code. Epic Games would need to establish and maintain stringent security measures to protect this data.

    Quality Control: Not all games are created equal, and some might not be useful for training machine learning models. Epic Games would need a process to ensure that the games they're getting access to are of a sufficient quality and variety.

    Legal and Ethical Considerations: Epic would need to ensure that their use of the source code complies with all applicable laws and ethical guidelines, particularly regarding data privacy and copyright.

    Fairness: The arrangements should be fair and mutually beneficial. Developers should feel that they are receiving value commensurate with what they are giving.

If Epic Games can navigate these considerations effectively, this could indeed be a viable strategy for cultivating the source examples needed to train their machine learning models for Unreal Engine. Offering marketing support and financial grants could be an attractive proposition for many developers, particularly smaller indie studios that might not have access to such resources otherwise.
