Summary Sequence Outline:

    Introduction:
        Introduce protagonist, Alex, who is enthusiastic, naive, and has a habit of taking people's words at face value.
        Alex is presented with a business opportunity by a charismatic stranger, Jordan.

    Rising Action:
        Alex is excited about the potential of the business deal and pours significant time, energy, and resources into it.
        Friends and family caution Alex, suggesting he looks deeper into Jordan and the deal.
        Alex, blinded by trust and optimism, dismisses their concerns.

    Catalyst:
        A close friend, Taylor, shares a personal story about a time they were betrayed because they failed to verify someoneâ€™s trustworthiness.
        Taylor offers to help Alex do some deeper digging on Jordan and the business deal.

    Climax:
        Together, Alex and Taylor uncover that Jordan has a history of scamming others with similar "opportunities."
        They also find out that Jordan is planning to disappear once he receives a significant investment from Alex.

    Turning Point:
        Alex confronts Jordan, who tries to manipulate and gaslight him. However, with the evidence stacked against Jordan, he eventually flees.
        Alex realizes the immense danger he was in and the potential loss he could have suffered.

    Resolution:
        Alex is grateful to Taylor and becomes more cautious in his future ventures.
        He spreads the moral "trust but verify" to others, hoping they can avoid the pitfalls he almost fell into.
        Alex starts a community initiative to educate others about the importance of verification in business and personal matters.

By the end of the sequence, the moral "trust but verify" is deeply ingrained in the reader's mind, emphasizing the importance of balancing trust with due diligence.
