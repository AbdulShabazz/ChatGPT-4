Second to the CEO resigning which other high profile resignation is a sign of distress within a public corporation?

ChatGPT:

Second to the CEO, the resignation of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is often viewed as a significant sign of distress within a public corporation. The CFO is responsible for a company's financial management, including financial planning, risk management, and financial reporting. Their departure can raise concerns about the financial health and stability of the company, especially if it's sudden or unexpected. Other high-profile resignations, such as those of Chief Operating Officers (COO), Chief Technology Officers (CTO), or even board members, can also be seen as signs of internal challenges or potential problems. However, context matters, so it's essential to consider the circumstances surrounding any resignation.
